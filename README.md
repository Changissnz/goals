# Goals

How can I possibly say that it is fair,  
When hard work is paid in pennies,  
And this is not a poem,  
To share with an insane Rome,  
When it lies so much as to ruin memories,  
Who cares, I dare.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Education, Career, Family, and Home Sweet Home

Why do I, at this age, not have a professional position
that pays me anything more but pennies? Let's see, there
was education via one of the U.S.A's college systems
(and at a liberal arts college no less, go me!) which took
a while for me to graduate from. And then there was the job
market and the COVID-19 pandemic, which were so full of 
SH** that I got left behind in the dust. I finally scored
a job as a technician for an electronics corporation, but
guess what... I was living in Portland, OR, (Portlandia sucks
by the way) and could not stand the environment, so leaving
back yonder "home" was what happened instead of me staying
on board as a technician.

In conclusion, that is why I feel as though I have not been
given my dues. I quite literally own so little that if I 
told someone else about my circumstances, they would laugh in
pity. I feel as though I have been done dirty, but from 
systematic mass policies (`o yah yah, nuthin personal, 
strictly business` [yeah okay...]). I hate my hometown because
it never did offer me much financial opportunities. And I also 
hate this additional fact, that if I were given my dues (although 
they would be need to be multiplied due to the loss of time), 
that I would be given additional problems as well. So much for 
the spirit of capitalism. These cons and thieves can eat SH**. 
Suck on DeezNuts!

*aside*  
Did I just use the word `hate` more than once in the last paragraph?!
Well, I guess it is official now. I really am a hater, isn't I? 
I'm not entitled, I am the title. I am...  
*end aside*

As for `home sweet home`, so much for all the love that supposedly 
happened. I'm not your one-hit wonder, and you'd best keep your
sad and pathetic FOCKING history and my personal life separate,
mmkay?! Is that cool with you, because I'm not going to keep
on playing along with the curse anymore, got that?! Understand?!
I do not need counseling. I do not need to talk about my emotions.
I do not need a woman companion in my life when there is that kind
of spirit in the air. 

Look at how tough and confident I am. Walking along in this course
of time, an equal among equals that is my neo-Roman peers. Wow, what
a powerful and magnificent neo-Roman empire that I am a citizen in.
Strutting around being the big guy without a care, because guess 
what?! You don't need to know, that's what!! Oh, and FOCK Nero. 
Everybody should hate Nero, no joke.

*aside*  
Yes, Mother! Yes, I will be home in a little bit. I know it's past  
your curfew. Please do not ground me!  
*end aside*

*aside*  
Wow, little sister Connie McLoughlin! You've grown so confident these  
past couple years. I would hate to get in your way, now that you are  
a full-grown hossie diva!  
*end aside*  

*aside*  
Wow, little brother Raymond Thompson! I see you rocking those new  
tattoos, dropping out of school, and fitting in with all those  
blue-collar guys.  
*end aside*

# Toxic Positivity 
What a good time to be alive. I can feel the aura of magnificence through
my five senses and beyond. The jolly wholly-hoppersteins alongside the
tranquility of grasshoppers eating their next meal is a great example 
of these feelings. 

*aside*  
I have deep-seated issues! I swear! Wah-wah, letting it all out by 
unknowingly ingesting truth serum first.  
*end aside*

*aside*  
FOCK.YOU.  
GO.FOCK.YOURSELF.  
FOCK.YOU.  
FOCK.YOUR.FAMILY.  
FOCK.YOUR.COVER.  
FOCK.YOUR.PRETENSE.  

YOU.ARE.THE.ONE.WITH.PROBLEMS.  
GOD.DAMN.YOU.  
*end aside*  

*aside*   
Who am I?! Ricardo Antonio Bassanio ?!  
Peter Lambucci ?! DAFOCK?!?!  
*end aside*

# A New Wisdom

Why I no longer want to be part of the race, after discovering that  
the race is all a rat race? Is that really a question? And I do not  
care to play along with the stupid tricks of old men. Yes. Yes. Call  
me a bastard now, as if you thought more highly of me before. As for  
these "Athena" types, please for your own good, take your wars  
somewhere else. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Younglings Are Worse

Remember what I said about the stupid tricks of old men. Old men,
despite their arrogance, are actually not dumb as a demographic.
It's the younglings. I'm not your big brother. The pressure's on 
you, you little FOCK. Watcha gon do?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Messed-Up Individualism

Hey... if anybody asks, I'll tell them that I do not stick out like
a sore thumb. And then if I feel like it, I'll tell them it's because
the collective never accepted me. Problem solved.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Necessary Apology and Respect

OK. Remember what I wrote about Nero? Well, I take that back completely.
Like so so sorry. I did not know that he was thee Emperor. Gosh... where
are my manners when I let my mind move ahead of its axis? 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# So This is My True Face

All the hate that I must represent. Go on. Chime in. FOCKING phony.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# South FL

Sucks bananas. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# More Drama, Please

Have you heard of Netflix?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# They Are Too Good For You Now

What?! Who?! Have we met?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The City Must Be Great

NYC? San Francisco? Shanghai? London? The possibilities must be endless...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Listen To Me, Please

Please. I gently ask you to listen to me, during these times very much trying for everyone.
Take my hand, and I will show you the world (not, and I never went to a liberal arts college
either). I will not liberate you. I do not believe in art, only arts. And what cannot exist
in a singular form cannot possibly be true in a plural form.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Why So Aggressive?

It is part of the zeitgeist that bonds us all, for a better  
world that is the planet Earth shaped as a globe.  

Sincerely, Yours Truly. 

Thank you for letting me speak, even if I had to shout above
your shouts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The 4th Industrial Revolution

I feel like there is a lot of misunderstanding around what  
exactly is the change. But there is no fun in knowing it all.  
There is absolutely nothing much that will change, except for  
the jobs people will do. Many people must be a little scared.

I will not say another word.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Be Grateful, Be Kind 

There's a lot of FOCKED-up people around. Now I don't want to
sound like a hater, but the FOCKED-up veterans w/o jobs, the 
FOCKED-up homelessness, some of these so-called "businesses", 
and BLAH BLAH BLAH means that I am entitled to not be grateful 
or be kind. Of course, there is virtue to being grateful and 
being kind, goes the many wise sayings. But it is not up to 
any one person to be grateful or be kind. 

There is no social obligation to be grateful or be kind, to 
clarify, because rules cannot be arranged to wholly capture
what is gratefulness or what is kindness. And this truism 
might add on to the FOCKED-upness. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Philosophy is Useless

It is supposed to be. It seeks to construct the fundamentals
from the vantage point of the thinker and stops when it is 
done rationalizing the base. No one philosophizes when they 
are working.

Philosophy is a thinker's hobby and another one of politic's
many tools.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Moving to the City

Well, I'm packing my bags now. It's been nice, but there is 
a grand city waiting for my arrival (yeah FOCKING right). 

*two months later*

What a zoo... And the madhouse business is right next door.
Incredible. Unbelievable. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Thank God for Family Values

Who can actually dismiss family values as nothing, when the
economy so evidently bellied up? 

Failure of the economy --> thank God for family values.

Well, I'm broke now. Time to go back to family, and be another
leech to treat the sick and dying.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reduction to Rags

The old dirtbag can't work. Well, so be it. There's social welfare in this country  
(well, the parts of the country that don't oppose social security). 

Hey, no disrespect to the gerontocracy, but I got my own life to live. You really  
gonna try reducing me to rags? Hey... this isn't hubris. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Special Select

Blessed be those that are specially selected to fulfill their dreams before 
first having to encounter the most trivial of problems compounded into 
monstrosities. I cannot say that they live on this planet.
