# Goals

How can I possibly say that it is fair,  
When hard work is paid in pennies,  
And this is not a poem,  
To share with an insane Rome,  
When it lies so much as to ruin memories,  
Who cares, I dare.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do I, at this age, not have a professional position
that pays me anything more but pennies? Let's see, there
was education via one of the U.S.A's college systems
(and at a liberal arts college no less, go me!) which took
a while for me to graduate from. And then there was the job
market and the COVID-19 pandemic, which were so full of 
SH** that I got left behind in the dust. I finally scored
a job as a technician for an electronics corporation, but
guess what... I was living in Portland, OR, (Portlandia sucks
by the way) and could not stand the environment, so leaving
back yonder "home" was what happened instead of me staying
on board as a technician.

In conclusion, that is why I feel as though I have not been
given my dues. I quite literally own so little that if I 
told someone else about my circumstances, they would laugh in
pity. I feel as though I have been done dirty, but from 
systematic mass policies (`o yah yah, nuthin personal, 
strictly business` [yeah okay...]). I hate my hometown because
it never did offer me much financial opportunities. And I also 
hate this additional fact, that if I were given my dues (although 
they would be need to be multiplied due to the loss of time), 
that I would be given additional problems as well. So much for 
the spirit of capitalism. These cons and thieves can eat SH**. 
Suck on DeezNuts! 

As for `home sweet home`, so much for all the love that supposedly 
happened. I'm not your one-hit wonder, and you'd best keep your
sad and pathetic FOCKING history and my personal life separate,
mmkay?! Is that cool with you, because I'm not going to keep
on playing along with the curse anymore, got that?! Understand?!
I do not need counseling. I do not need to talk about my emotions.
I do not need a woman companion in my life when there is that kind
of spirit in the air. 

Look at how tough and confident I am. Walking along in this course
of time, an equal among equals that is my neo-Roman peers. Wow, what
a powerful and magnificent neo-Roman empire that I am a citizen in.
Strutting around being the big guy without a care, because guess 
what?! You don't need to know, that's what!! Oh, and FOCK Nero. 
Everybody should hate Nero, no joke.

What a good time to be alive. I can feel the aura of magnificence through
my five senses and beyond. The jolly wholly-hoppersteins alongside the
tranquility of grasshoppers eating their next meal is a great example 
of these feelings. 

*aside*  
I have deep-seated issues! I swear! Wah-wah, letting it all out by 
unknowingly ingesting truth serum first.
