*NOTE: these are musings and should not be interpreted as absolute truths*

# Goals

How can I possibly say that it is fair,  
When hard work is paid in pennies,  
And this is not a poem,  
To share with an insane Rome,  
When it lies so much as to ruin memories,  
Who cares, I dare.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Education, Career, Family, and Home Sweet Home

Why do I, at this age, not have a professional position
that pays me anything more but pennies? Let's see, there
was education via one of the U.S.A's college systems
(and at a liberal arts college no less, go me!) which took
a while for me to graduate from. And then there was the job
market and the COVID-19 pandemic, which were so full of 
SH** that I got left behind in the dust. I finally scored
a job as a technician for an electronics corporation, but
guess what... I was living in Portland, OR, (Portlandia sucks
by the way) and could not stand the environment, so leaving
back yonder "home" was what happened instead of me staying
on board as a technician.

In conclusion, that is why I feel as though I have not been
given my dues. I quite literally own so little that if I 
told someone else about my circumstances, they would laugh in
pity. I feel as though I have been done dirty, but from 
systematic mass policies (`o yah yah, nuthin personal, 
strictly business` [yeah okay...]). I hate my hometown because
it never did offer me much financial opportunities. And I also 
hate this additional fact, that if I were given my dues (although 
they would be need to be multiplied due to the loss of time), 
that I would be given additional problems as well. So much for 
the spirit of capitalism. These cons and thieves can eat SH**. 
Suck on DeezNuts!

*aside*  
Did I just use the word `hate` more than once in the last paragraph?!
Well, I guess it is official now. I really am a hater, isn't I? 
I'm not entitled, I am the title. I am...  
*end aside*

As for `home sweet home`, so much for all the love that supposedly 
happened. I'm not your one-hit wonder, and you'd best keep your
sad and pathetic FOCKING history and my personal life separate,
mmkay?! Is that cool with you, because I'm not going to keep
on playing along with the curse anymore, got that?! Understand?!
I do not need counseling. I do not need to talk about my emotions.
I do not need a woman companion in my life when there is that kind
of spirit in the air. 

Look at how tough and confident I am. Walking along in this course
of time, an equal among equals that is my neo-Roman peers. Wow, what
a powerful and magnificent neo-Roman empire that I am a citizen in.
Strutting around being the big guy without a care, because guess 
what?! You don't need to know, that's what!! Oh, and FOCK Nero. 
Everybody should hate Nero, no joke.

*aside*  
Yes, Mother! Yes, I will be home in a little bit. I know it's past  
your curfew. Please do not ground me!  
*end aside*

*aside*  
Wow, little sister Connie McLoughlin! You've grown so confident these  
past couple years. I would hate to get in your way, now that you are  
a full-grown hossie diva!  
*end aside*  

*aside*  
Wow, little brother Raymond Thompson! I see you rocking those new  
tattoos, dropping out of school, and fitting in with all those  
blue-collar guys.  
*end aside*

# Toxic Positivity 
What a good time to be alive. I can feel the aura of magnificence through
my five senses and beyond. The jolly wholly-hoppersteins alongside the
tranquility of grasshoppers eating their next meal is a great example 
of these feelings. 

*aside*  
I have deep-seated issues! I swear! Wah-wah, letting it all out by 
unknowingly ingesting truth serum first.  
*end aside*

*aside*  
FOCK.YOU.

# A New Wisdom

Why I no longer want to be part of the race, after discovering that  
the race is all a rat race? Is that really a question? And I do not  
care to play along with the stupid tricks of old men. Yes. Yes. Call  
me a bastard now, as if you thought more highly of me before. As for  
these "Athena" types, please for your own good, take your wars  
somewhere else. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Younglings Are Worse

Remember what I said about the stupid tricks of old men. Old men,
despite their arrogance, are actually not dumb as a demographic.
It's the younglings. I'm not your big brother. The pressure's on 
you, you little FOCK. Watcha gon do?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Messed-Up Individualism

Hey... if anybody asks, I'll tell them that I do not stick out like
a sore thumb. And then if I feel like it, I'll tell them it's because
the collective never accepted me. Problem solved.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Necessary Apology and Respect

OK. Remember what I wrote about Nero? Well, I take that back completely.
Like so so sorry. I did not know that he was thee Emperor. Gosh... where
are my manners when I let my mind move ahead of its axis? 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# So This is My True Face

All the hate that I must represent. Go on. Chime in. FOCKING phony.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# South FL

Sucks bananas. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# More Drama, Please

Have you heard of Netflix?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# They Are Too Good For You Now

What?! Who?! Have we met?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The City Must Be Great

NYC? San Francisco? Shanghai? London? The possibilities must be endless...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Listen To Me, Please

Please. I gently ask you to listen to me, during these times very much trying for everyone.
Take my hand, and I will show you the world (not, and I never went to a liberal arts college
either). I will not liberate you. I do not believe in art, only arts. And what cannot exist
in a singular form cannot possibly be true in a plural form.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Why So Aggressive?

It is part of the zeitgeist that bonds us all, for a better  
world that is the planet Earth shaped as a globe.  

Sincerely, Yours Truly. 

Thank you for letting me speak, even if I had to shout above
your shouts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The 4th Industrial Revolution

I feel like there is a lot of misunderstanding around what  
exactly is the change. But there is no fun in knowing it all.  
There is absolutely nothing much that will change, except for  
the jobs people will do. Many people must be a little scared.

I will not say another word.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Be Grateful, Be Kind 

There's a lot of FOCKED-up people around. Now I don't want to
sound like a hater, but the FOCKED-up veterans w/o jobs, the 
FOCKED-up homelessness, some of these so-called "businesses", 
and BLAH BLAH BLAH means that I am entitled to not be grateful 
or be kind. Of course, there is virtue to being grateful and 
being kind, goes the many wise sayings. But it is not up to 
any one person to be grateful or be kind. 

There is no social obligation to be grateful or be kind, to 
clarify, because rules cannot be arranged to wholly capture
what is gratefulness or what is kindness. And this truism 
might add on to the FOCKED-upness. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Philosophy is Useless

It is supposed to be. It seeks to construct the fundamentals
from the vantage point of the thinker and stops when it is 
done rationalizing the base. No one philosophizes when they 
are working.

Philosophy is a thinker's hobby and another one of politic's
many tools.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Moving to the City

Well, I'm packing my bags now. It's been nice, but there is 
a grand city waiting for my arrival (yeah FOCKING right). 

*two months later*

What a zoo... And the madhouse business is right next door.
Incredible. Unbelievable. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Thank God for Family Values

Who can actually dismiss family values as nothing, when the
economy so evidently bellied up? 

Failure of the economy --> thank God for family values.

Well, I'm broke now. Time to go back to family, and be another
leech to treat the sick and dying.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reduction to Rags

The old dirtbag can't work. Well, so be it. There's social welfare in this country  
(well, the parts of the country that don't oppose social security). 

Hey, no disrespect to the gerontocracy, but I got my own life to live. You really  
gonna try reducing me to rags? Hey... this isn't hubris. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Special Select

Blessed be those that are specially selected to fulfill their dreams before 
first having to encounter the most trivial of problems compounded into 
monstrosities. I cannot say that they live on this planet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# It is a Crisis!

It's another one of those Godzilla scenes!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Dull Patriarch

Look at the head of the household. Family values! Big man!
Don't let it get to your head now, big man!

Oh! It's head honcho! King of the hill!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Way

Your old ways do not put me to shame. What puts me to shame
is having to obey your way when there is a better way.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Leadership Issues

So there needs to be a leader or pack of leaders leading at  
the forefront. Where are they? Sipping fine wine and making  
love to each other while everyone else is to labor away?  

The old ones are becoming unfit, are they not? But some of   
the newer ones have just as many issues, probably passed  
down from the old ones.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Lost Love

What strange way to wake up in the middle of a deep sleep,  
and think long and hard on the love that could have been  
but never happened. 

And so here is another tale of lonesomeness.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# It Is Not That Great

Oh, finally ends were met and emotions were let out.  
But it is over now and to each their own must they depart.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Bargain and the Strings 

The deal has been reached. What was once nothing from the  
eyes of the value system now has worth equal to its labor  
and rarity. But what is this? There are these conditions  
attached with this influx of monies?! All these conditions?!  
And why are these conditions so open to interpretation?!  

Maybe this is a bad deal...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# After the Anger

After the anger, there is a lethargy that sets into the  
spirit. What was once the fuel that drove the motives  
behind the spirit to drive forward, uni-directionally,  
without the restraints of mental barriers that previously  
existed, is now exhausted. 

And the remaining energy? To repent, to give up, to  
conjure up more anger, or to celebrate? 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Curse

The curse requires a believer in it. Additionally,  
the curse requires repetition of the pre-requisites  
necessary for it to unfold.  Such repetition  
can occur through examples such as deliberate or    
indeliberate human behaviors and environmental  
constructs suitable for the curse to manifest  
itself. The curse demands an inevitability  
that stems from the inability or stubbornness  
to change.  

I do not wish to delve more into the matter.  
I do not practice black magic.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Misery Best Left Alone

So there is misery, and a cause for this misery.  
And after all the sad songs are sung, there is  
still that misery. The cause of the misery, the  
solution and the problem.  

If that is all to it, misery is best left alone  
lest misery is to be shared, and then the cause  
of that misery, what was deemed the solution and  
the problem, is now uncontrovertibly the problem.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Time and Place For Profanity

Profanity is a big party foul. But I did not  
attend the party.

Does this make sense? Are you OK with that?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Complex Problems

Require more than just strong men, although the odds would be better.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The New Way

Big announcement. Big marketing. The New Way! Here it comes!  

*some time later*

The new way will need a lot more time to take effect. There are  
a plethora of problems with all these dilly-dackadoos, systems,  
economics,...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Thoughts

These are your thoughts, world. Your thoughts.  
I merely took the liberty of writing them down for you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Your Admirer

Is not your friend when you two have to compete with each other.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The New Gen

*spoiler alert*  
New generation. New problems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# An Unspoken Perversion

Is always expressed in different ways by different lights.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Distant Love

Is dead when you rather talk to yourself in front of the mirror.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Correct Continuity

Is still controversial in the debate room.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Money

Is a symbol, a responsibility, an incomplete form of transfer,  
an objective, and a continuity.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Empire 

Is best learned about through the history books. 
There are only facts, beliefs, and constructs in  
this life you live.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Neighborhood Vandal

Keyed the entire left side of my vehicle, no lie.  
They say I'm a leftist. A sorry loser.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Paint Job

It's OK, I got a paint job, like that one lady   
that puts makeup on every single time before  
doing the dirty with every single person except  
you. Say whaat?! What am I talking about?!

I'm looking for an EV anyways. Nothing fancy,  
but definitely not traditional. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Not Funny

Was it supposed to be? 

*of quips and wits*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Automated Writing

Word to the wise, don't feel sorry for all of the  
writers getting laid off because of automated  
writing and speaking.  

The professional ones were always like  
"every dog has its day",  
"it's only fair"  
just a few years back. Or ...  
"it's a tragedy",  
"it's a sensation".    

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Power of Subjectivity

Do not underestimate any one person's  
need for subjectivity.  

There is a lot of business involved  
in subjectivity. And this statement  
cannot really be disputed.  

If the person is in charge, and they  
want to maintain an iron grip on every  
person below, there is absolutely the  
possibility that they will bring any  
challenge or challenger into question,  
this being the realm of subjectivity,  
if they feel as though such acts would   
enhance their social position as the  
one in charge. And this same person in  
charge will also ensure that they are  
not seen in a subjective light by those  
below them, since to be subjective  
naturally corresponds to being open to  
question.  

Subjectivity is not reserved only for  
politics. When the machinations of science,   
that is technology and logistics, fall short  
of understanding or solving the problem,  
whichever may be the goal, then subjectivity  
is called for so that different interpretations  
can be made towards different conclusions that  
hopefully (as in by some measure of chance)  
perform better.  

Subjectivity is a tool for consensus when  
it does not lean so heavily towards strong  
differences in opinions and actions. The  
common saying is "agree to disagree".  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Social Pressures

Are tools that do not work when they do  
not relate to the core, the central point  
that they push on, especially if the core  
is not bounded by all degrees.  

As to the morality of binding things, that  
is a discussion and a writing that will  
remain incomplete.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is Empire

The word "empire" carries such rich and diverse  
interpretations. You see it in the movies, the  
shows, and in the writings from both sides of  
the bridge.

The Roman Empire is an exemplar in the genre of  
"empire". 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Not About the Money

It's not entirely about anything. The mind is   
malleable and must be re-calibrated from time  
to time so that focus is maintained.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Save Your Words

Your words will fall on deaf ears,  
and your writings will be looked at  
by the illiterate.  

Your words will be drowned out by  
other words from other speakers that  
hold more favorable positions. Your  
words, if valuable, just as well be  
spoken or written by someone else  
if they were to have their way.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Virtue of Deprivation

People get specially selected by  
the powers that be to embark upon  
routes of life that put them at  
odds with what routes they would  
have originally taken if they would  
have had their way, without the  
external influences from both afar  
and near, based on their preferences  
from the beginning. Underneath, they  
may actually still prefer those  
routes of original preference,  
but on the outside, they are deprived  
of the experiences from those routes.  

The virtue of deprivation is  
essentially based on the appearances  
of what those deprived do and how  
they act, from the standpoint that  
there are flaws in each person stemming  
from what they desire and do.  

The choice of individuals to  
wholeheartedly submit to  
embarking on the routes specially  
selected by the powers that be is    
a topic of long and contentious  
discussion.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Out of Line

Give the person a place they  
feel comfortable in, on the  
condition that they must appear to  
be a nice person by saying and  
doing nice things, and you will  
not hear or see much on the surface.  

Feed people vocabulary terms that  
have contentious interpretations,  
such as capitalism and socialism,  
and take them out of their comfort  
zone. Then you will hear outcries  
against "capitalism", against  
"socialism", against all of these  
"-isms", alongside personal attacks. 

Making people see the "light"?  
That is a question. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Thievery

Thievery is an interesting topic  
for discussion. It happens in both  
capitalist and socialist systems. In  
one, there is for personal gain. In  
the other, it is for the greater good.  

Thievery comes in many forms. In some  
places, it is akin to taking candy from  
a baby. In other places, it is more  
outright conflict.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Stoop Down

Equity policy time! Every person that  
is not of royalty and does not have  
proof that they are descended from  
royalty and is not an indisputable  
conqueror needs to give up their  
ambition, at least half of their  
personal belongings, do not act so  
smart, and know their place! Or else  
they will be labelled as unequal!  

Only the greatest individuals can  
enter the contest. Only those that  
can pay can be spectators.  

This is New Rome, people! Do as the  
New Romans do, speak as a New Roman  
and be gladly accepted into a role  
that you may not like or speak freely  
and suffer the consequences. Free  
speech is not free, and freedom is  
not free!

For a better day today, tomorrow, and  
for the foreseeable future in New Rome!  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Glories of Strangers

A complete stranger and their tales of
conquest or liberation, in this new age
of correctness that is political makes 
for another internet article that is 
completely forgettable if there are 
present problems abound for the mind 
and body.

# A Hilarious County

I will tell you some reasons why my  
hometown in Charlotte County is  
hilarious. 

There are no white-collar jobs. It  
is suburbia. So if someone wants to  
move to Charlotte County to work in  
the technology industry, then they  
will be met with sore disappointment.  
I bet a lot of people have heard about  
the breathtaking developments in A.I.  
and other related industries. Charlotte  
County does not understand. There is  
only real estate and minumum wage. Get  
on board or drown is the moral here. 

It has an education system built on   
the Florida law of "no child left  
behind", so the statistics and the  
realities are out of touch. 

The rich old folks that move down  
here have it the best. This is an  
indisputable fact because the county  
did get voted as one of the U.S.A's  
best retirement communities.

There is a lot of small talk and  
gossip. There is small talk and  
gossip everywhere, but Charlotte  
County is unique because all of the  
small talk and gossip amounts to the    
same old same old suburbia. And it  
is predominantly serious talks and  
gossips too, not that BS meant to  
let people understand the follies  
of life. 

There is no social mobility in  
Charlotte County. It is like a little  
Constantinople Junior. The political  
people of Charlotte County are  
staunchly Republican, and seem to  
despise the federal government. But  
what is this? A hurricane called Ian  
came through a year and a half ago, and  
many residents still do not have relief  
so that their residences get rebuilt  
again. So Charlotte County wants to  
be practical now, and pushes for  
Steube, that's the House Representative  
for this county, to pressure the  
federal government for more aid  
(what a stooge). Oh, so now  
you are a pragmatist, Charlotte  
County. Before that, you were a  
traditional hub of hospitality with  
a keen focus on developing real estate  
and building apartment and hotel  
complexes for the tourism industry.  
Gotcha. Gotcha. Now I know where  
your heart is at, Charlotte County.  

You're whack, Charlotte County.   
Even if you're not as dysfunctional  
as the declining Portland of Oregon,  
there is something very wrong with you.  
I bet there is something very wrong with  
all regions of the world. It is just  
that I have had enough of you to grow  
as a person. You embody the seven  
deadly sins just as well as New York  
City, Portland of Oregon, London, and other  
metropolises that you so despise because  
they have democratic bases and you are  
so conservative and Republican. You  
don't see yourself. You hate social  
mobility and talent. And you represent  
an America that is bound to decline  
because you are so fixated on yourself.  
You Philistine swine. You and your idea  
of a banana republic.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The New Arrivals

The economy is hot, it's on fire! The  
jobs are definitely there, immigrant.  
If you're unskilled, go work blue-collar.  
It pays well, especially up north in the  
U.S.A. where there are unions and human  
rights, unlike the U.S. south according  
to the mainstream media. 

If you have an H-1B visa, you are so set  
for life here in the U.S.A. You are gold  
and can choose which Fortune 500 technology  
corporation to work for.  

What a great place to be, in the U.S.A!  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Little Paradises

I do not think my hometown is the worst.  
I spend a lot of my free time with my head  
lost in the written words of the internet.  
There is always talk of big changes coming  
from magnificent places, call them little  
paradises, that always sound so much better  
that what is already here. So in many ways,  
I am deceived into the realm of delusion.  

There seems to be problems everywhere, from   
a fair perspective. It is not really about  
getting ahead anymore when a person sees  
problems everywhere. Instead, the objective  
becomes to maintain the functionalities and  
enhance well-being. But some regions of the  
U.S.A. really are ahead by some metrics.  
From my perspective, those regions might   
be a little vain but at least they have  
something to show for besides from mass  
appeal, mass marketing, and self-promotion.  
In other words, some regions are more  
constructive and research-oriented. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Infeasibility of FOSS

F.O.S.S. stands for free and open source  
software. As many have come to realize,  
ever since COVID-19, the software  
industry is not very stable. The software  
industry, which relies on commercialization,  
seems to be having problems generating  
revenue, let alone profits. The industry  
is in many ways getting outsourced to  
less developed regions of the world,  
since they obviously need those digital  
products more. This trend means that many  
people in developed nations with either  
the potential or the existing capability  
to engineer good software products  
(scientific, reliable, not vaporware) are  
forced to go work in other industries  
that require virtually no knowledge  
in digital technologies. The advanced   
and overly technical nature of software  
development means that most software  
engineering is done by corporations, not  
governments.  

There has always been strong resistance  
from various organizations against  
open-source software. This resistance  
is so predictable from my perspective  
because F.O.S.S. usually provides  
equal benefits to their adopters  
at no monetary cost in comparison to  
commercial software. An equal competitor  
means less profits and less control.  
But the question of software maintenance  
and security alongside hardware necessary  
to run it is complicated, but is not  
monetarily free in general. This fact  
means that those that can acquire the  
hardware resources necessary to run  
these software products are at a great  
advantage to establishing a stronghold  
in the business of software. The  
semi-conductor industry is undergoing  
changes... As for the F.O.S.S.  
developers, if they are not sponsored  
to develop the F.O.S.S. anymore, then  
they are left to do whatever within  
their means, such as becoming bohemians  
or entrepreneurs. The business of software  
is very awkward from a materialist's  
perspective. There is no tangible object.  
Absolutely no tangible object. The  
software can only be uploaded or  
downloaded into tangible objects.  
The financial industry and its blockchain  
cryptocurrency splinters have vested  
interests in the software industry.  
On the less shadier side, there is  
the advertising industry that pays  
to put up these promotions,  
advertisements, and other forms of  
messaging using digital means. And  
last but not least, there is venture   
capitalism, which I will not discuss

# What is Decline?

The word "decline" rings a funny bell in  
my ears.   

To let new things in, unfiltered and  
unrefined, is a path towards decline.  

To remain both unyielding and barricaded  
in the face of change is another path  
towards decline.

To do virtually nothing, is decline.

# Now I See

Now, I still see nothing as expected

# Why Vice and Inequality? 

Here is a question. Why are some  
regions of the world so much better  
than others measured in terms of  
effectiveness, productivity, and  
way of thinking? 

I do not think that religion can  
fully answer, because the seven  
deadly sins are a part of every  
region in this world. Maybe some  
regions of the world have magnitudes  
and ratios of the seven deadly sins  
that enable them to achieve more  
and keep more. Also, there is the  
matter of personal preference,  
meaning that some places would  
suit specific persons better than  
others.

# Say Nice Things Please

You are probably flabbergasted and  
disgusted by some of these things you  
read in this file. It is OK, here is  
my apology.  

I will say and write nice things.  
And then when you are no longer  
present, I will say really mean  
and nasty things about you, with  
the intent as to not upset you.  
And then those words will carry  
far, very far because you know,   
"sound travels and people talk".

Lo and below, what I have just  
described is modern day  
passive-aggressive politicking.  
I cannot imagine that this has  
changed much over the course of  
thousands of years of human  
civilization.

# Be the Solution, Not the Problem 

Fine, so maybe I wrote some harsh things  
about my hometown. Maybe I should try to  
be the solution, not the problem. Maybe I  
should try to put my talents and skills to  
good use. You know what they say, right?  
"Real talent can't be stifled."  

Ooh... I have some ideas. How about  
Charlotte County buy millions of dollars  
worth of robotics and start producing things  
by automation? How about Charlotte County  
stop with the ditch-digging and hire robots  
instead? How about Charlotte County build up  
a university that provides free college to  
enlighten every person that is interested?  
How about Charlotte County buy robots to do  
the lawn mowing (but so many small landscaping  
businesses would be out)? 

You see what I am talking about with these  
questions. It is vain. What I propose is vain  
and absolutely unnecessary because Charlotte  
County does not have the demographics for answers  
to those questions to swiftly appear. Other  
regions take priority.

See. I am a practical person. I understand that  
some things have to be lived with, and some things  
have to be sacrificed just because there is not  
enough initiative. That is why I remain perfectly  
comfortable no matter my state of mind or circle  
of friends.

# I am a Big Thinker! Me! 

You are probably already familiar with  
those characters in fiction and real life.  
They have big ideas, big plans, big  
aspirations. They work tirelessly to  
realize their vision. It is up to them to  
turn big ideas into a better world, a  
better realism.  

But somehow, it is incredibly difficult  
for them to do simple and normal things.  
That is because they always think big,  
and do big things and ignore the little  
things.  

Come on. Join the bandwagon. Think big  
things! Do big things! Change the world!  
Never mind the simple things that you have  
never bothered to try to do, or the many  
flaws you must have from doing big things  
all the time!

# Social Contact

Science is incomplete for the human  
experience. And that is because a lot of  
the work does not require social contact  
that is more than research collaboration.  

Social contact is vital. So vital. Without  
social contact, there is a lack of social  
contact. 

Social contact allows the human experience  
to transmit to other human experiences  
through the projection of identities,  
super-identities, egos, and super-egos. 

And don't forget, social contact is one of  
the best ways to express love. "Love is the  
answer to everything" is what many say.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What Do People Really Do?

Serious question. Sometimes, I really do  
wonder what some people, or should I  
say, peoples (plural, denotes multiple  
persons planning or conducting  
activities with each other) do.

And then I remind myself of the four  
necessities of life, that is food, water,  
air, and shelter.

I also remind myself of basic  
psycho-analytic concepts, especially  
identity and ego, that transpose  
themselves into societal structure,  
which then reflects back into the  
perspectives of individuals' identities  
and egos, fueling their emotive states  
and ultimate wills.  

I could go on to more detailed  
explanation, but I will not. I will  
say that today's post-modernist dynamic  
has led to a lot of routes that would  
have never existed if it were not for  
the combination of wretched and  
wonderful chains of events in the past.  
Even with some of these improvements,  
I have still personally concluded  
that social arrangements such as  
tribalism still play a role in the  
hearts and minds of many, leaving the  
question of choice on the table not as  
part of an open discussion but for  
private deals.

# A Recipe with Jealousy

Jealousy operates by underhanded  
methodologies. Even the jealous know  
that jealousy is a prime factor for  
irrationalism that can just as easily  
bury them as grant them cheap victories,  
so their way about victory heavily  
emphasizes the concealment of said  
prime factor. But it is not always  
an orderly world for what exactly is  
order, goes their justification. 

Jealousy is cryptographic. It is one  
of the great drivers for deception.  
It is fair to say there are as many  
methodologies devised to detect friend,  
foe, or stranger as to conceal  
allegiance due to jealous inclinations.

A cunning jealousy exacerbates present  
problems, morphing those problems into  
greater problems through systematic  
destabilization. To clarify, pride  
can also do these things, but jealousy  
goes about it in a more underhanded  
way, because jealousy is not pride.  
Pride is the incumbent, the  
established, the powerful through  
merit of both mind and body. Jealousy  
lags behind. There are many losers,  
but jealousy does not accept its  
position until its death. When pride  
continues waving its superior stance  
to jealousy, jealousy becomes even  
more jealous. A jealousy that  
thrives is a jealousy that will  
continue its campaign, first to  
dethrone and then to be the new  
pride. And then it is no longer  
jealousy but pride, at least for  
some time. 

Much can be said and believed about  
those that embrace jealousy into their  
hearts or befriend the jealous. But  
one thing is for certain, jealousy  
is one of the seven deadly sins.

# There is No Need for Education 

When education is a system, and  
the person does not feel they would  
benefit by passing through that  
system as an input variable. The  
passing of the input variable into  
an education system induces changes  
into the input variable. What is  
interesting is that those changes  
and the initial state of the input  
variable are then reflected back  
onto the education system, causing  
the education system to be somewhat  
different than what it was originally,  
before the person passed through  
that education system. 

When education is a system, however,  
and the person chooses not to enter  
that system, then they must obviously  
take other routes and bear different  
costs and effects.

# Monotony Through Themes  

One of the great uses of expression  
is apparently to relate one thing  
as another from one to another.  
There are parallels between two  
very apparently different nouns  
or experiences, and these parallels  
are forged through the craft of  
monotonization. Some processes  
that manifest themselves differently  
but rest on the same sources  
can also be greatly and positively  
related to one another through  
explicit emphasis of the equality  
between the sources. 

One shortcoming of natural language  
is that it cannot be so readily  
interpreted past a certain point.  
It is not that the possibility for   
immediate and deep interpretation  
is not there, but natural language  
is usually used in conjunction with  
other contextual signalling. The  
permutative reaction from this  
conjunction has a high probability  
of resulting in mixed and vast  
interpretations. To demonstrate  
the true nature of some of these  
interpretations requires a  
feedback loop from the interpreter  
with themself, others, or a  
mixture of both. From the  
perspective of the central mean  
theorem, the feedback loop  
starting from the interpreter  
and ending with both themself  
and others would provide the most  
reasonable answer, given the condition  
that all of the ends of the feedback  
loop (the interpreter themself  
and others) are reliable and  
accurate judges of equal caliber.  
If the interpreter is left to their  
own devices so that only they themself  
comprise the total number of agents  
involved in the feedback loop, then  
there is a high risk of error for  
interpreters untrained overall and a  
higher risk of error for those  
inexperienced in the specific  
circumstances surrounding the  
communication.

Each feedback loop is part of a  
long chain used to maintain a  
constant bridge of accurate  
interpretation between the interpreter  
and the subject of interpretation,  
that is expressed through natural  
language. The interpreter would  
then have to constantly corroborate  
the communication of the present  
with the past to recalibrate  
interpretation towards the objective  
of a best range of answers for  
the foreseeable future where the  
subject of interpretation is to  
remain the subject for interpretation.  
And this range of answers is usually  
kept narrow for faster computation.  
By this construct, deep interpretation  
can only take place through the trials  
and errors that have taken place through  
predominantly deliberate efforts, since  
the magnitude of intention corresponds  
to a higher priority for retention of  
the specific memory for particular  
trials and errors. 

The long chain, comprised of feedback  
loops, falls under monotony through  
themes. Through the consistency that  
emerges from refinement for improved  
interpretation by the interpreter,  
events or concepts expressed through  
natural language that may not have  
originally carried any semblance to  
one another are then attached to each  
other through the forging of  
parallelism. The discovery and  
maintenance of focus on the points  
of origination, which may change in  
qualities or quantities over time,  
that which allow for relatability of  
different communication through  
natural language is a task that the  
long chain of feedback loops dedicates  
itself to. So the activities revolving  
around the points of origination also  
fall under the umbrella of monotony  
through themes.

The phrase "natural language" usually  
refers to languages with wide adopters  
spoken between human beings, but the  
definition of "natural" is puzzling (to  
say the least) because the term relies on  
the existence of a state that is, by  
default. And said state may not actually  
exist across the different regions and  
contexts of all possible interpreters.  
And the definition of "natural" is  
probably better measured in terms of  
the mutations that have occurred rather  
than the similarities that exist then  
and now. The reasoning is that the  
concept of monotony through themes  
implemented by the long chain of  
feedback loops would convolute and  
distort the past and present "natural",  
leading to errors such as delusion of  
similarity and false or overabundant  
parallelism.

# Lost For Words

If you are in this state and it is

no difference to you, that ignites  
a flame inside you not to buy  
into the message, but to dish out  
your own flame. 

Herein lies the generalization of

exponentially many more views.

# Condensation, Clarity, and Others

When vast texts can be condensed,

To clarify, there will be other

makes differences when condensation  
can grant clarity for the confidence  
to move as one?

# There Are No Individuals, Only Individualists

Individualism is one of the many  
ideals that human beings have come  
up with. And this particular idea is  
very appealing in theory, especially  
for those that place low emphasis on  
the permanence of social bonds and  
other forms of association such as  
financial independence that interfere  
with their way of life and expression.  
But a fellow human being has a degree  
of influence proportional to their  
actions, social connectivity, and  
physical distance concerning an  
individual, in turn enabling doubts  
to be cast on what exactly sets a  
person apart from others as an  
individual.

Individuals are ultimately human and  
fall prey to humanistic aspects such  
as identity, ego, social arrangements,  
social trends, and order. Each of these  
aspects carry with them equations in  
the form of certainties or likelihoods  
(if there is a lack of certainty) that  
result in not so much the removal of  
free will from individuals in what they  
desire to do, or what they want to  
represent, or what they think, but in  
the diminishing of choices that are  
feasible to accomplish without  
necessary external influence, that  
which is usually formulated in  
structures  of other persons' inputs.  
The phrase "to fall prey to" does  
not necessarily refer to arbitrary  
and inevitable losses or deprivations  
that an individual must experience.  
Instead, the phrase in this context  
refers primarily to the loss of  
individualism by the individual in  
such a manner that to call the person  
an individual would result in  
fallacies of their conception at least  
equal to the misconception that they  
are indeed an individual.  

One metric for gauging the  
individuality of a person is the  
strength of arguments against the  
aims of their volition. A person may  
in fact be dismissed as an individual  
due to the strength of arguments  
against their volition, when the  
person if considered in a context  
devoid of other nouns (such as other  
persons) can in fact be deemed an  
individual. And these arguments may  
rest on identity, ego, social  
arrangements, order, amongst others.  
To gauge the strength of arguments  
against a person's individuality  
requires an astute assessment of  
their repressive and suppressive  
effects on the person's expression  
and existence amongst others. And  
such repressive and suppressive  
effects must be observed through the  
lens of scenario modelling, divergent   
behavior, and the strength and nature  
of relations between the person and  
other persons.

Another metric is one that rests on  
comparative analysis, but this metric     
is related to the last concept  
regarding the observation of  
repressive and suppressive effects  
of arguments against a person's  
individuality. However, comparative  
analysis in this form does not  
necessarily take arguments against  
a person's individuality into account.  
It strives to use relevant information  
in the form of measures deemed  
"socially objective", agreed upon by  
a consensus of those both informed  
and representatively credible.  
Measures of a person's appearances,  
genealogy, and practices have stronger  
likelihoods of being recognized as  
socially objective than values placed  
on their psyche and capabilities.  
Comparative analysis takes measures  
such as these into account and attempts  
to draw "distinguishing lines of  
recognition" between a person and  
others. The objectivity wanted through  
comparative analysis places limits on  
the metric itself since the conducting  
of studies cannot go in-depth past a  
point into a person without mentioning  
the nature of arguments against the  
person's individuality that is already  
discussed in the previous paragraph  
concerning a different metric.  

To call any arbitrary person an  
individual would have a strong likelihood  
of dispute given the previous two metrics  
mentioned. The person may not, based  
on things such as their personal values  
and behavior and relations, be an  
individual. But the person can still be  
an individualist, a believer in the  
ideal of individualism. The threshold  
for a person to be an individualist is,  
in many ways, lower than that to be an  
individual. A person would simply have  
to carry with them a strong belief in  
individualism. And as for the question  
of their ability and actualization in  
upholding their personal belief in  
individualism, it would have to be  
determined under metrics such as those  
two previously mentioned. A person  
may score low in some metrics of  
individualism but still exhibit other  
appearances, behavior, and actions  
that are individualistic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Short-Sold

An individual does not realize how  
far they can go, given their natural  
abilities, efforts, and socio-economic  
support until they can go no longer.  
And during these travels this individual  
takes, they must acknowledge to themselves  
every once in a while doubts on if they  
are to be sold short.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Insecurity Apparatus

Most people are familiar with the  
concept of the security apparatus.  
Without the security apparatus,  
comprised of the various police  
forces, civilian networking, and  
capital management, there is  
obviously a lack of security for  
some people.

Insecurity apparatuses are  
essentially the weaponization of  
components of the security apparatus  
against those that were originally  
designated for protection by the  
security apparatus.  

The shifty nature of human to  
human alliances, relations that  
depend on long-lasting  
responsibilities and the upholding  
of designated roles, necessitates  
questions to be asked on what  
exactly is the security apparatus  
and how such a vast concept  
actualized should have any real  
guarantees independent of the  
human alliances of the human  
beings that the apparatus is  
or was (if it becomes an  
insecurity apparatus) catered  
to defend. 

A crucial aspect of the security  
apparatus is its incredibly  
conservative nature. Loss is  
a negative metric when used to   
analyze the effectiveness of a  
security apparatus. And this  
loss takes forms in ways  
including theft of physical  
objects, destruction of physical  
objects, loss or damage to life,  
as well as social arrangements  
and environments intended to  
deprive certain humans of  
their capabilities and pursuits.  
The conservation that a security  
apparatus seeks is antithetical  
to the insecurity apparatus  
that it can metastasize into,   
due to the whims and strategies   
of those inside or out of the  
security apparatus.

# I Am Roman, I Am Legion

The title is an example of  
"There Are No Individuals,  
Only Individualists". 

Imagine yourself as a  
well-trained and well-learned  
one, skilled in the ways of  
order, efficiency, and other  
ways of exerting power. But  
you know you are not that  
special. It would defy your  
training since you were taught  
to fight in a unit composed  
of multiple persons. You are  
not really an individual when  
in your legion, but a Roman.

Hence, you are Roman, you are  
Legion. Sure, you may have  
individualistic features and   
beliefs. But you do not want  
to be entirely viewed as an  
individual, especially by the   
enemy. This is so that whenever   
they try to think of you the  
Roman, their mind is forced to   
think about you the Legion as  
well.

# Set Up, Tear Down

Experience these carefully  
crafted chains of events enough  
times, no matter your moral  
compass or degrees of  
intelligence, and you can  
understand where your chances  
and trash cans are.  

The concept is so widely used  
that even the Python programming  
language implements "set up, tear  
down" in its testing procedure.  
Testing "sets up" an environment  
where the code to be tested can  
be inserted as the input variable,  
and after the code is tested,  
Python "tears down" the setup to  
clear memory.  

The concept of "set up, tear down"  
depends on the passivity of the  
input variable, and in cases of  
real life, that would be you the  
person instead of computer code  
for a Python test. The ethics and   
ramifications of "testing" a person,  
especially when they choose not to  
pursue education or a position that  
requires them to pass the test, are  
typically up for debate due to  
the convoluted nature of human  
reasoning in regards to what is  
a proper test for persons that  
would ensure a proper range of  
results upon those persons'  
successes or failures. When the  
results of the test have been  
properly collected, there is  
then the "tear down" portion.  
In both of these portions, the  
person that is tested is a  
passive force in the sense that  
they do not tamper with, let  
alone design, the "set up" or  
the "tear down" portions.  
Interestingly enough, a person that  
is able to "set up" the testing  
for themselves can manage to  
engineer odds more favorable  
to their winning than before.  
And a person that is able to  
"tear down" a test, at arbitrary  
points during its running, can be  
said to be resistance, a resistive  
force against the test.  

The "set up, tear down" procedure  
is drastically more expensive for  
the person than the same procedure  
used to test Python code. The reason   
is simple: you only live once.

# Silence! Historiano is Talking!

Hush! Do you not recognize who that  
is that is clearing his throat to  
speak? It is the one and only  
Historiano, the only candidate that  
anyone can trust when it comes to  
the moot topic of history.  

Whereas some challengers to  
Historiano may state their  
superiority over him due to their  
various strengths including the  
art of persuasion, dramatism, and  
performance, it is only Historiano  
that can speak accurately of  
history, using a conscientious  
style of expression on the  
chains of human events that took  
place in the past. Bear in mind,  
this is not a matter of a math  
contest or a demonstration of  
wits and mights, but history.  
Many might be similar to  
Historiano when it comes to  
history, but Historiano has  
reputation through ancestral  
precedence. And without  
reputation, there is no  
history.  

Without Historiano, a descendent  
of the family that is recognized  
as the most powerful line of  
historians, there would be no  
history to discuss or listen to.  
There would be only opinion,  
without roots.

# The Playbook

Ever see an actor, actress, or  
actre say lines or do things in    
a manner most unbefitting to  
their "nature", if human beings  
are predisposed to specific  
"natures"? Note that the terms  
"actor", "actress", and "actre"  
are those assigned to the  
persons that "act" and do not  
require them to be  
professional.  

Then they are doing it by a  
playbook that they did not  
write. For matters of  
authenticity, they are phony.  

But if the show sells enough  
to rake in at least as much  
money as is spent on it, "so  
be it" is the expected answer  
from most.

Maybe they are just on drugs.  
That is right. Taking drugs

# A.I. Is Everything, A.I. Is Nothing

Speaking of "acts" that appear

there is expected to be much  
"unnaturalness" stemming from  
the ongoing developments in  
A.I. (that stands for  
artificial intelligence). 

A.I. is supposed to be able  
to predict virtually everything,  
perhaps not with the absolute  
accuracy that some people on  
the perfectionist's side prefer.  

A.I. is also supposed to be  
able to simulate and replicate  
virtually everything, perhaps  
not with the absolute accuracy  
that some people on the  
perfectionist's side prefer.  

A.I. is supposed to do these  
things by continual training  
on information collected.  
A.I. is bound to be artificial  
since the "A" does stand for  
artificial. So it is actually  
nothing from the lens of  
authentic existence and  
thought, so goes the orthodox  
thinking from human minds.  
But it is supposed to mean  
everything since it is fed  
all kinds of information,  
anything that is information.  

Perhaps A.I. is not digital,  
since it is supposed to  
represent nothing and  
everything at the same time.  
Maybe it can only be anything  
and nothing at the same time  
by being quantum.

# Pacified For Good

Pacification requires no words  
of explanation once the state  
has been achieved. Whatever  
words that are used in pacified  
states are to conserve the  
pacification.

Pacification is not a barrier.  
Pacification is an achievement.   
Pacification means there is no  
perceived worth doing or pursuing  
anything if there is hurt involved.  

But the means to pacifism do  
not constitute pacifism itself.  

Pacified...

# Insecurity Apparatus Pt. 2

The first part on the concept of  
an insecurity apparatus defines  
it in the terms of a metastasis  
from a security apparatus. This  
definition may sit poorly in  
some contexts, since the term  
"metastasis" does signify a  
change clearly geared towards  
malicious activity with aims  
that are fatalistic in some  
cases. 

A key point to note is that  
insecurity operates on  
instability, the lack of  
structural integrity from  
foundation (or lack of  
foundation) to any other  
connected point in the  
structure. Instability is  
one of the ingredients in  
feedback loops necessary to  
generate more if not maintain  
insecurity. And insecurity then  
manifests itself as behaviorial  
anomalies (expressed outward)  
or self-contained afflictions.  
And suppose that if "order"  
is to "constant", then  
"insecurity" is to "chaos".  

Insecurity, from the perspective  
of those deemed threats that have  
to experience what they perceive  
as harmful effects eliciting from  
the apparatus after it has morphed  
from a security to an insecurity  
apparatus against them, is then  
prone to less than objective measures  
due to differing opinions from those  
that live and think by different  
views and have different labels  
assigned to them by the apparatus   
that then treats them differently  
according to those labels.  

For simplicity, not for perfection  
for perfection requires a fine  
grain knowledge and method of  
operation for all sub-problems  
and those sub-problems'  
exemplifications of any problem  
that the apparatus is designed to   
solve, an insecurity apparatus  
is easier judged to be an  
insecurity apparatus birthed from  
a security apparatus than an  
apparatus that is an insecurity  
apparatus from the perspectives  
of some of those that are served  
by it but a security apparatus  
from the perspectives of others  
that are also served by it. In  
the second case, the differing  
opinions coupled with roughly equal  
magnitudes of credibility and  
executable power lead to a  
poor following in upholding the  
categorical labelling of the  
apparatus as one that is a  
security apparatus or an  
insecurity apparatus. 

Metrics to argue for this preference  
in definition revolve around the  
constants guaranteed by the  
apparatus in operation after  
its supposed "metastasis into  
an insecurity apparatus". An  
"insecurity apparatus" guarantees  
less overall control for those  
it serves, and this includes  
both those that do not have  
any executive authority over  
the apparatus as well as those   
that have operating control  
over the apparatus. This loss   
of control can be measured  
after observation of the  
diminished degrees of freedom  
guaranteed alongside the  
magnitude of risks involved  
in attempting to either  
execute or remove specific  
freedoms from specific individuals  
served by the apparatus. If  
the concept of the constant is  
to be taken as an undeniable  
aspect of the security apparatus,  
then patterns such as rapidly  
changing agendas, unpredictable  
changes in leadership, and  
unforeseen crises that can have  
their sources externally or  
internally are not only not  
the desired outcomes of a  
security apparatus but also  
not the actual outcomes caused  
or enabled by it. On the other  
hand, outcomes generated from  
the competencies and intentions  
of an insecurity apparatus tend  
to fall short of aims that that  
same apparatus declared, whether  
privately or publicly, to be  
imperative to achieve.  

These notions on what "security"  
and "insecurity" are with regards  
to the apparatus do not take into  
full consideration the yearnings  
stemming from those served by  
the apparatus, who may each have  
specific wants that the apparatus  
cannot cater to. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Insecurity Apparatus Pt. 3

There are bound to be arguments  
abound for what an insecurity  
apparatus is according to the  
two proposed definitions in the  
previous part. An apparatus  
could be judged as an insecurity  
apparatus by some but not others  
that it serves. The basis behind  
this definition would result in  
conflicting differences in  
labelling of the apparatus.  
These differences are due to  
inversions of the dichotomized  
understanding and perhaps experience  
of security and insecurity from  
a reference point, meaning one  
or some that are served by the  
apparatus, by one or more other  
points. The problem of inverted  
judgments of dichotomies in the  
context of an apparatus that is  
supposed to serve for security is  
usually promoted by overly broad  
approaches to understanding, in  
which the understanding that is  
judged to be flawed by the other  
side is nevertheless used to  
act upon by those that stand  
by it if not thought of it.  
This specific category of approaches  
has the characteristic trait of  
rushed conjectures to dichotomize,  
in order to fully specialize  
for the specific problem, with  
the purposes of first to be able  
to conveniently express the  
differences between any two  
that complements the whole of any  
one, then to use the confidence  
and focus from that convenient  
expression to act solely for the  
initiative. In the context of  
a security apparatus, this leads  
to viewpoints that may not align  
based on both the specific and  
differing results that are used  
as proof and also the understanding  
that is attributed as the cause of the  
apparatus being not one of security  
but insecurity.

The issue with the definition of  
an insecurity apparatus resting  
on the judgments of those it serves  
can be resolved by a simple approach,  
albeit this simple approach would  
result in an equal if not greater  
(expected) response against the  
apparatus due to its being judged  
as that that elicits insecurity.  
The simple approach involves  
constructing a dichotomy between  
those that support the security  
apparatus, perhaps because the  
apparatus would offer them security  
beyond a reasonable doubt, and  
those that do not support the  
security apparatus, in turn  
deeming the apparatus an insecurity  
apparatus by the one-or-the-other  
assignment through dichotomies. In  
this dichotomization, the first  
category are those that are "served"  
by the security apparatus, perhaps  
even  "serving" the security apparatus  
by operating it. The second category  
would be those that are "dealt" by  
the security apparatus, in which  
their judgments of the apparatus  
may be either that it is for or  
against security but the apparatus  
would not place emphasis on "security  
measures" for them. The second  
category would also not have their  
judgments considered by the security  
apparatus so that the security  
apparatus can modify its approaches  
towards their wants. Specifically,  
introspection taken by the security  
apparatus does not consider the  
judgments of this second category  
based on their perspectives and  
experiences due to said apparatus.

Focusing on the other definition  
of an insecurity apparatus, one  
that is judged to be so by its  
metastasis from a security  
apparatus, the prime issue is  
recognizing the transitioning (metastasis)  
of the security apparatus to an insecurity  
apparatus. This would be classified  
as a judgment problem, complicated  
by magnitudes correlating to  
the nature of secrecy involved in  
the security aimed for by the  
apparatus. 

Both definitions of an insecurity  
apparatus fall short of the  
specificity necessary for  
real-world actualization. The  
separation of the theoretical  
correctness from the actions taken  
leads to corrective measures  
during introspective phases  
of operation that take place  
after phases of execution.  
Corrective measures include expressing  
those actions as actions done for  
security when there is contradiction  
expressed by those served by the  
apparatus and abrupt changes in  
security practices that are not  
judged as rational or amenable by  
some.

# To Make Efforts Lost Hurt Right Down to the Core 

In the cases of extreme persistence,  
maybe this objective is the only   
way to make a specific person  
understand the errors of their  
ways. 

But generally speaking, such  
efforts are subject to opposing  
views such as that they are cruel  
and unusual, in other words,  
unnecessary although those that  
enact the losses may derive an  
atypical magnitude of pleasure  
from doing those things. 

To take routes with this objective  
as the aim, expect there to be  
not much friendship that can  
foster with those inflicted  
without them becoming unusually  
pretentious due to their  
defensive psyche bolstered  
towards distrust against the  
inflictor. This is if their  
will is not broken. If their  
will is broken, can you expect  
them to act as they themselves  
without your impact and influence?  
You cannot.  

The issue with speaking of this  
objective in terms of theoretics  
is that there is not much to be  
learned that can then be used  
for corrective purposes without  
calls for the need for opposite  
and equal efforts spearheaded by  
anti-corrective purposes.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The United States

Ever since I was in elementary  
school, I have always thought of  
the United States as a country that  
turned into a modern-day Rome.  

One big reason why is that I  
believe the nation is very  
propagandistic. Now I don't  
want to take another step  
and say the country acts on  
false principles and worships  
false prophets. What I am  
saying is that the American  
spirit, fostered by initiatives  
such as valuing debate over  
labor, theatrics based on  
Greco-Roman tradition, and  
upholding a secrecy that forever  
escapes the front pages is  
part of the "propaganda  
machine". I am not saying  
that the concept of the  
"propaganda machine" is unique  
to this nation, but rather it  
is effective enough to serve  
the interests of more than  
half of the citizens, by a  
rough estimate. Ancient Rome  
had a very effective propaganda  
machine. I do not feel the need  
to use sources on this point.  
Instead, take a look at the  
information on the regions  
surrounding the Mediterranean  
during the Roman era. The  
instability of the so-called  
Roman Empire that occurred after  
its conversion from that of a  
"republic" is also reflected in  
the remnants from and legacy of  
its "propaganda machine". During  
those eras deemed declines, there  
were actors that took precedence  
over the generational offspring  
from the original Romans that founded  
the Republic. There are different  
kinds of glories attached to those  
actors that form a separate identity  
against the Roman Empire, or at  
least the imperial leadership of  
the Roman Empire.

The United States, from my  
perspective in this modern-day,  
seems to have ideations of decline  
on top of whatever problems it  
really has. These ideations of  
decline are discussed daily on  
the front page and by citizens  
of all stripes and colors. And  
this year, 2024 the election year,  
has amplified this activity.  

Another big reason why I continue  
to validate my views that the  
United States is very much a  
reincarnation of Ancient Rome,  
with slightly different  
ethno-demographics (if ethnicity  
is really that important) and  
more advanced technology (due  
to the advances made since the  
last sacking of Rome by different  
peoples that are incorporated  
into the nation's infrastructure),  
is that promotions to leadership  
positions strongly favor the  
seniority of individuals'  
family tree in this nation and  
outside of it. I am not making  
this up. Take a look at the  
list of approximately 50 presidents  
that have served this nation.  
Then take a look at the commercial  
clans of this nation, based on  
their specific industrial specialties.  

I expected more from being a  
citizen of this nation, truthfully.  
I am not mincing words here. But  
this sentiment has been replaced  
by another, and with no hurt  
feelings from my end. Sentiments  
of entitlement, that is what  
expecting more is, have been  
replaced by a strong sense of  
skepticism. I believe very little  
outside of the basics. And what  
exactly did I feel entitled to?  
A job that pays over the minumum  
necessary for me to persist, that  
I enjoy doing because I have an  
intellectual liking for it or at  
least passionate about it. Housing  
that is not complete SHITE. It is  
not a coincidence that I still live  
with my parents even when I am  
rapidly approaching middle age.  
I do not believe in coincidences  
when it comes to the deliberate  
actions taken by individuals that  
form what is deemed group-based  
results. I view this condition of  
my daily life as a big test of  
caring less and less. I care less  
and less by not giving a rat's  
ass about the many "success"  
stories that I read about.  
Typical "success" stories include  
a person that has immigrated from  
another country or their parents  
immigrated from another country.  
And somehow, the person becomes  
really successful. And then  
their story gets promoted by  
some demographic groups as,  
you know, The Example...  

For me, at this point in my life  
with the perspective I have  
developed, I cannot really imagine  
life outside of the United States,  
although most of my years so far  
have been spent in the hottest  
and most tropical state in this  
nation. So what if I have blood  
relatives in the other hemisphere?  
What have they really done for  
me? I plan to relocate to  
another region of the United  
States and take up work that  
better accomodates my skills  
and pursuits by the end of this  
year. Sorry, Florida, but you  
do not represent the entire  
United States. You might never  
will.

# The United States Pt. 2

I am really going to "run  
away" from all of this. I  
will move to Los Angeles,  
become a screen writer AND  
producer for the film industry.  
Then I will experience the  
greatest glamour in the  
whole entire world. This is  
what I want, right?

# Half the Price, Twice the Labor, Double the Fall

This title sums up any  
"over-achiever" that does  
not get their "fair share"  
from achieving past the  
threshold for passing.  

I thought of Count Dooku  
from Star Wars before  
coming up with it.  

When the price for labor  
is halved, then there  
can be two workers.  
Understand? Then "double  
the fall" is when  
those two workers are  
stuck working those  
jobs until they retire.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Lowest Form of Engineering

Award goes to social engineering.  
Social engineering requires, first  
and foremost, the deliberation to  
deceive someone or some group of  
persons so that their actions  
become geared for motives outside  
of their realm of knowledge.  

The aims of social engineering  
are to control persons through  
subversion, misrepresentation, and  
fear that may or may not border  
on terrorism.  

Those that social-engineer do not  
have aspirations to produce any  
material products or immaterial  
knowledge. However, they can  
still social-engineer others to  
do the bidding of producing  
material products or immaterial  
knowledge. Social engineering  
constitutes zero-gain (at best)  
initiatives and do not guarantee  
reliable results due to its  
reliance on the social factor.  

Social engineering is best  
considered a sub-branch of  
political science and psychology  
than an actual field of  
engineering.

The best social engineers do not  
produce or construct anything.  
They go on to become leaders,  
primarily in media and politics,  
right where they belong, although  
they may not be the heads of the  
show. This is because Aristotle  
lives to this day, for better  
or worse.

# Franchises I am Boycotting

I am boycotting Dairy Queen  
for a long while. That Oreo  
Blizzard I was served yesterday  
was political. It was completely  
white on top, and the top  
went up narrow like a pyramid.  

About halfway through the  
Blizzard was when the Oreos  
started to appear, so that  
the Blizzard could be white  
and black.  

And the blizzard sparked up  
my allergies. I think that  
is the big reason for my  
boycott. The staff that  
served me that? A mix of  
Spaniard and Slavic types.  

Strange mofos.

# The New Denunciation Of Social Media

National governments, alongside  
journalists aligned with them,  
have been continuing their assaults  
against social media through  
the levying of taxes on these  
giants, regulations on the  
algorithmic operations and  
individualized content served,  
and promoting mass outrage.  
This trend has been going on  
since about 2016, about the  
same time the United States  
welcomed its 45th president.  
The year is now 2024, and  
despite the ongoing legal feuds  
with the New Media giants such  
as Facebook, challengers to  
these platforms outside of  
the judicial system have not  
been able to come up with  
better alternatives. Quite  
truly that this can so be  
said, and one of the best  
pieces of evidence is the  
stock prices of these social  
media giants in comparison  
to their challenger companies.  
These general figures are not  
the most certain and absolute  
metrics on the social media  
giants, admittedly, because  
they do not highlight the  
downsides of using these  
platforms and the shortcomings  
of these platforms' underlying  
infrastructure. How could they?  
These deficits are part of  
the giants' big stash of  
trade secrets. Exposing sensitive  
information, no matter from the  
poorest beggar or the most powerful  
social media giant, requires  
a kind of clearance and authority,  
in technical terms. In theoretical  
terms, however, exposing sensitive  
information on any person or  
persons or organization constitutes  
an assault on their capital. The  
question of if the target that  
was exposed truly deserved it,  
by the vantage points of  
righteousness and fair play  
and justice and so on and so  
forth, is so hefty a topic that  
if I were to be in charge of  
doing research on the topic, I  
would rather hire a prestigious  
lawyer to do it for me (if I  
had the capital to afford the  
service). 

There is an interesting article  
by a Paolo Confino on Fortune  
that is titled "Americans are  
getting fed up with social media  
companies, they just don't want  
the government to do anything  
about it". I agree with the  
title. I really do. The problem  
is that it is easy to be a critic.  
For example, I have been called  
ugly and undesirable before.  
"So vut, vanna fight about it?"  
This has been the best description  
of the chain reaction going on  
in the various feuds against  
social media. Performative  
defenses and offenses, because  
there has not been any better  
solution that what the existing  
social media giants have to offer.  
Some typical anecdotes in the  
fight against social media go as  
such:  
- a little girl saw sexual content  
  on Facebook. Well... how did she  
  get past the age requirement for  
  an account in the first place?  
- a little boy gets introduced to  
  guns and drugs by watching videos  
  on Facebook. Again... how did he  
  get past the age requirement for  
  an account in the first place?
  
I have a suggestion on how to deal  
with cases such as these. The answer  
is to implement firewalls that use  
artificial intelligence. These firewalls  
will collect relevant identifying  
information, such as social security  
number, photo and fingerprint identification,  
amongst other details. But there is  
a downside, as many have already  
figured. The downside is that more  
sensitive information will be collected  
by these social media giants. There  
will be less online anonymity when the  
internet infrastructure, with its  
already abundant suite of security  
protocols, uses more sensitive  
information in the quest for security  
and accountability. And in the  
advents that those social media  
giants get "hacked", then the  
attackers have the prospect of  
gaining even more sensitive  
information on the consumers than  
before.  

Another notion of mine that I want  
to put out is that social media  
as an application of digital  
technology has already reached the  
apex as a democratic tool of  
expression. Before social media,  
most of the popular media in the  
United States existed on Big  
Television channels. The themes  
of narcissism, megalomania,vanity,  
lust, heroism, and psychopathy so  
frequently depicted remain virtually  
the same back then as now. It is  
just that in today's world, Big  
Television no longer has a monopoly  
on what performers get to shine in  
the spotlight and what themes  
deserve the attention of the  
audience for the day. Instead,  
social media giants have ushered  
in a kind of democratization  
process in the media industry that  
is distinct from what existed  
before their rise to prominence.  
This democratization process is  
what I call "mobocratization".  
"Mobocratization" is when an  
influencer is able to build a  
following large enough that is  
willing to fork over enough money  
to them so that their works  
distributed over social media  
platforms can net them enough  
capital to do more than simply  
survive. The rigid structuring  
of Big Television before social  
media giants allowed for  
aristocratic principles to follow  
through from start to finish more  
effectively.  

The monetization process in the  
media industry, and this includes  
social media giants, is part of  
the tertiary sector of the economy.  
The tertiary sector, in other  
words, is the services industry  
and is, from the perspective of  
hierarchy, the greatest economic  
achievement of a developed  
economy. Media is merely one of  
the many institutions in the  
tertiary economy. Doctors and  
lawyers are also part of the  
tertiary economy, for example.  
Monetization is quite difficult  
to achieve in the high-tech  
industry. Capital funding, in  
many cases, is exponentially  
easier for a company than it  
is for the company to be able  
to generate a consistent and  
substantial revenue based on  
the merit and adoption of its  
products. One reason to believe  
social media as a product may  
have already reached its apex  
is measurements of adult usage,  
and the record of technological  
leaps made in the social media  
industry. These measurements,  
which exclude artificial  
intelligence developments that  
are not exclusively pioneered  
by social media giants, have  
stagnated, according to many  
sources. Other portions of the  
media industry that are not  
part of the social media  
giants, such as the news  
industry, also have significant  
problems generating revenue. One  
big cause that they attribute to  
is that the social media giants  
have bit hard into their revenue.  

From the perspective of the  
commoner, perhaps these feuds  
against social media giants are  
merely feuds over influence in  
the media industry. I cannot  
imagine that media technologies  
can possibly improve any further  
by objective measures, separate  
from cultural and political  
interpretations, without mass  
upgrades in electronic hardware  
and consumer knowledge in the  
underlying technologies behind  
what is consumed on the screen.  
What I find much more fascinating  
to read about are the advances in  
emerging technologies such as  
virtual reality, brain-computer  
interfaces, and integration of  
artificial intelligence  
technologies into existing  
infrastructure. These advances  
are pioneered by these social  
media giants, in great part  
because these organizations were  
originally founded as technology  
companies, companies that produce  
technology primarily in the form  
of platforms for use by  
consumers and small businesses.  
So is it politics and social  
activism that made its way  
into these social media giants,  
or did these social media  
giants get into politics and  
social activism? The answer  
is subjective.

# "Poison Politics"

I recently read an article by a  
U.S. newspaper agency that couples  
the concept of "poison politics"  
with "Putin's Russia". I find it  
intriguing that Russia is explicitly  
singled out by the newspaper as  
engaging in poison politics.  

No further comment. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Political Animal

Out of the various lessons that  
can be taken out of Greek philosophy,  
perhaps the most important one goes  
something as such: "man is a political  
animal". What exactly does this statement  
mean? Most human beings on this planet  
are not politicians. In many regions of  
the world, there is a direct and single  
correlation between being a politician  
and being of royalty. This holds true  
even in societies generally regarded  
as "democratic". So the occupation of  
politics, from this fact alone, seems  
extremely exclusive even if a political  
system is able to serve the interests of  
many, i.e. democratic. The most rational  
interpretation of "man is a political  
animal" is that each human being,  
regardless of the condition that they  
are a politician, operates by social  
concepts for their own desired results  
of unity and disunity. The cumulative  
effect of each human being operating by  
social concepts amongst each other  
is trade-off and power dynamics through  
their interactions. And these trade-off  
and power dynamics, if designed and  
fully acted through according to the  
political will of stability and  
prosperity, result in drastically better  
conditions amongst the human beings  
(political animals) than if the human  
beings were to go to each their own  
way and have negligent interaction  
with each other.  

Why need politics? It is because  
someone always knows better, or  
someone is better. The order of  
politics presupposes that there are  
those that just so happen to be  
more capable or fit than others,  
and the social construct needs to  
be structured according to a vision  
from those most informed, capable,  
and fair. This is true in both  
egalitarian and elitist political  
systems, that which both require  
administrative centers. Those that  
push for egalitarian systems tend  
to de-emphasize the existence of these  
administrative centers, and those that  
are elitist do the exact opposite and  
usually state their affiliation or  
role with the administrative center  
as part of their intrinsic and  
much-deserved identity on top of  
others.  

The overarching concept of politics  
is usually discussed as a sort of game,  
where there are winners and losers,  
the decorum of appearances and the  
backroom, and the expected versus  
the actual results achieved. But  
because a person's livelihood is at  
stake, the recreational aspect of  
the term "game" makes the term  
improper from types of perspectives  
such as emotionalist and  
existentialist.  

Who is to really say that someone  
is more fit or capable than someone  
else? This question really has no  
definitive answer that is outside  
of the judgments of human beings.  
There are, of course, formulae that  
can be used. Collect the pertinent  
variables of any two or more, and  
input each of those sequences of  
variables into the formulae. Then  
the outputs should reveal some  
inkling at least on who is more  
fit or capable. But there is a very  
big detail that has been forgotten  
through this train of thought; is  
being fit or being capable more  
important? The answer is quite  
subjective, and even if someone  
were to prefer one over the other,  
then there is still the question of  
the climate and persons being compared  
since exceptions do occur. The matter  
of fitness and capability can be  
inserted into formulae to give at  
least an idea of who is really  
better, but there is still no  
guarantee that the idea is valid  
or produces any guarantees if stood by.  
But even the construction of the  
formulae is subjective. Do the  
formulae even need mathematical  
reasoning on paper to be called  
formulae, or can they simply come  
from the hearts and minds of those  
that are recognized as participants  
in the decision process? And  
lastly, there are two mentalities  
to go about judging whether one  
is more fit or capable over  
another. One mentality is the  
predictive and betting type, who  
modify their own plans and strategies  
to suit who they think will win.  
Those with this mentality usually  
take a neutral stance towards those  
that are in comparison but a proactive  
stance that uses probabilities for  
their own interests. And the other  
mentality is the believer or the  
biased mentality, in which there  
is a preference to call someone more  
fit or capable over another. Concepts  
such as the "natural leader" are  
extremely important in political  
contests. Character backgrounds become  
that much more scrutinized and  
cross-examined.

Another broad concept in the  
political nature of human beings is  
the trade-off, the antithesis to  
the absolution that some seek in  
the context of politics. The  
networking so present in every  
political system sprung up because  
of the trade-off. This entails the  
differentiation of roles, values,  
and material goods (part of  
geopolitics) because of asymmetry.  
Somehow, through the various  
trade-off dynamics that manifest  
themselves in ways such as the  
broad examples of supervisor-worker,  
server-client, producer-consumer,  
teacher-student, and master-slave,  
there are codependencies that are  
forged between political animals in  
the same political system alongside  
hierarchies that may or may not be  
fluid in their structuring based on  
the specific contexts that those  
hierarchies are invoked in. 

Politics, based on the exemplification  
of trade-offs that were recently  
mentioned, then can be understood  
as ubiquitious. It is how human  
beings see each other past the  
initial identifiers of identity and  
ego. Politics, as formally practiced,  
requires a reasonable amount of  
debate and even questioning, even  
in the more absolutist variants.  
This fact is the reason why there  
is the saying "leave politics out  
of it". The innate biology present  
in human beings serve as a great  
motivator for amplifying competition.  
To clarify, there is no lessening  
of competition if politics is to  
be considered a game where there  
are roles to be won. The competition  
can take different forms that may  
deceive some human beings into  
believing that there is no  
competition. This amplifying of  
competition can be done through  
increasing the threshold for  
success/recognition or placing  
restrictions on the practices and  
strengths of certain contenders  
in politics. Typical idioms such  
as "dog eat dog world" support  
this approach to thinking about  
politics if it were a game. When  
a person takes things for granted,  
and has few if any questions to  
ask about the trade-off, the role,  
or the judgments, and additionally  
does not amplify the harshness in  
the trade-off, the strength of  
their role, or their own judgments,  
then they could be considered,  
from an empirical standpoint,  
non-political. But it is not always  
politics because pain and suffering  
are inevitable, the pure existentialist  
says. And the pure emotionalist with  
an aching soul would say that they  
just want to be happy. They do not  
want politics because politics is  
real enough to make them feel emotions.

# The Human Element Against A.I.

The effects of ongoing developments  
in artificial intelligence are hard  
for deep discussion. I assume this  
to be true for the typical person  
that has at most a high-school level  
understanding of mathematics, not  
that mathematics is the only credible  
field for understanding the effects  
of artificial intelligence. Alas,  
youth is seldom left to its own way  
to develop according to the dictates  
of passion. Some might disagree with  
this statement and say that it is  
the mentality of disciplinarians  
and hierarchs. But look patiently  
and closely at the drivers of human  
motivation in any occupation, whether  
it be the sternness of military  
occupations or the whimsical  
activity of the artisan, and one  
can be sure to learn that not all  
of those drivers exist in and of  
the individual persons.  

Refocusing back on the developments  
of artificial intelligence, there  
seems to be a wide spectrum of  
notions on it as a good. There are  
some that are very enthusiastic  
about it, believing that the  
delegation of thought and skill to  
machines trained over recordings  
and representations of those  
thoughts and skills will be able  
to perform at least as well as  
human laborers. And what's more?  
Since those machines are equipped  
with algorithms that can process  
big data multitudes of times faster  
than human beings and can then  
turn into tools more valuable  
than even their makers according  
to the value of productivity and  
capability, then the rapid  
developments in artificial  
intelligence will, sooner rather  
than later, culminate into a  
fantastic and virtually impeccable  
product in terms of performance  
over human beings. Then there are  
those, both the educated gentry  
and pseudo-educated mass populace,  
that are skeptical of artificial  
intelligence. I suppose the field  
of economics, with its old-fashioned  
Keynesian thought, is not  
particularly fond of artificial  
intelligence as a good but perhaps  
still believe in the power that  
artificial intelligence can grant  
(in some situations). And that  
power is to be contained, so  
goes the thinking of many. The  
stock market's tendency to behave  
towards volatility gives credence to  
these skeptics on the idea that  
artificial intelligence is an  
over-valued product based on cryptic  
(proprietary) design and that those  
that promote artificial intelligence  
may be really good at pitching ideas  
to potential buyers and with science,  
but ultimately barely have any real  
clues on the fundamental needs of  
human beings based on their cultural  
and geographic circumstances. And  
there are some that express notions  
of fear against artificial  
intelligence. The reasoning is  
that if real change will occur  
because of labor demands due to  
artificial intelligence and  
artificial intelligence is assigned  
responsibilities that may jeopardize  
the welfare of human beings,  
then artificial intelligence is  
at least as much of a threat as  
an asset, a two-sided sword per  
se. 

The rationales and spirits for  
and against any of the above  
three views are essentially  
based on the interests of  
individuals, if one can really  
call a person an individual  
if they are beholden to  
interests comprised of many  
persons and that may also  
include non-human elements.  
What exactly are the institutions  
that are making these  
developments in artificial  
intelligence? A basic  
categorization would be  
military, corporate, and  
university interests, although  
there is much overlap between  
these three groups. According  
to media sources, there is a  
race going on in artificial  
intelligence. It is fair to  
say that any nation that has  
moved past being a nation that  
is predominantly agricultural  
has vested interests in  
artificial intelligence. These  
"races", for lack of better  
terms, are a part of the  
human element against artificial  
intelligence. Ironically, when  
one competes against another to  
develop and possess the same  
goals, the winner may take  
all and give back less.  

It is my perspective that  
artificial intelligence, despite  
the great calls from many that  
artificial intelligence should  
be developed for the "global  
good", is an elitist product  
based on the business and  
political dealings that have  
taken place and will continue  
to take place. To elaborate,  
artificial intelligence may  
be able to accomodate the  
needs of many from many  
backgrounds, but the fruition  
of the ideas that greatly aid  
in building the backbones of  
artificial intelligence are  
from the minds of some of the  
greatest thinkers, not your  
typical layman. And the owners  
of the commercial varieties of  
these artificial intelligence  
systems predominantly come from  
well-to-do families with historical  
connections to commerce. The task  
of understanding artificial  
intelligence takes a backseat  
for the consumer who would much  
rather put their time to using  
the automation capabilities to  
boost their own productivity,  
what they judge to be for  
better use than sitting down  
and pondering about ideas in  
computation, then having to take  
the additional step of validating  
their understanding of artificial  
intelligence by looking at the  
mountains of computer code that  
do not seem to make much sense  
since the code was probably  
written by software engineering  
teams that had to split up the  
thought and labor into producing  
the artificial intelligence  
product. 

The systemic nature involved in  
mass-marketing products that  
have a great potential for  
disruptive change, such as the  
steam engine and the automobile,  
speaks poorly for the possibility  
of artificial intelligence to  
seamlessly and silently inject  
itself into the lives of typical  
human beings so that happiness  
and prosperity is guaranteed to  
be preserved. Activities of  
"hacking the system" will not  
decline from the adoption of  
artificial intelligence. And  
these activities of "hacking"  
systems are better classified  
as human rather than machine,  
unless the system was designed  
so poorly that it is bound to  
"hack" itself.  

One can already witness the  
great human element in the  
form of labor strikes and  
protests in the U.S.A.,  
and one would have  
probably thought that this  
nation's claim to being a  
top hub for artificial  
intelligence would entail  
the benefits of social  
and labor adjustments to  
allow for less  
dissatisfaction from various  
groups. The simple explanation  
is that dissatisfaction even  
in the developed world is not  
due only to the developments  
in artificial intelligence;  
there are other factors involved  
as well.  

The issue with the human  
element in the context of  
technological change is that  
human beings tend to lust for  
power and control rather than  
understanding, especially if  
they feel as though their  
welfare will be threatened  
beyond their reasonable  
range of control. The  
"survivalist mentality" craves  
for stability and reliability  
at costs that may involve  
other human beings. 

Some proposals and enactments  
are already present at this  
time. Ideas such as universal  
basic income, championed by  
progressives, and government  
regulations have reached the  
front-page of the news industry.  
Corporations also play a role  
in labor demands, alongside  
the financiers from banking.  

It is fair to mention one  
other aspect of the human  
element against artificial  
intelligence. This one is  
quite important to understanding  
the ramifications of artificial  
intelligence as a mass-marketed  
product, and it is called  
conservatism. Fiscal conservatism  
takes the form of devaluation  
against marketing that tends  
towards inflationary practices  
and labor instability. Social  
conservatism varies according  
to different regions of the  
world. For example, India  
historically had the caste  
system. In the context of  
artificial intelligence  
invoking change, social  
conservatism undoubtedly plays  
a great role in maintaining  
the "order" and the "rankings"  
of specific persons and specific  
groups based on, for lack of  
an accurate phrase, a plethora  
of factors.  

After reviewing these topics,  
one can reasonably come to  
believe that not much can  
possibly change without greater  
changes outside of the realm  
of relative control. There  
is still the social construct  
and social contracts. There  
are still supply-and-demand  
dynamics that need to be met  
in the primary and secondary  
sectors of the economy before  
advancing the tertiary sector  
that may or may not include  
artificial intelligence.

# The United States Pt. III

There is more to the United  
States than what I discussed  
in Pt. I. In my hasty attempt  
to draw a parallel between the  
United States and Ancient Rome  
through the two major points,  
that the United States is  
propagandistic to a similar  
magnitude of influence as  
Ancient Rome and its leadership  
is structured according to  
strong geopolitical if not  
directly familial connections,  
are not unique to the United  
States. I can name many  
nations that practice these  
two points off the top of  
my head. 

I suppose that the scale  
comprised of these two  
attributes' breadth and  
depth enable the United  
States to stand out among  
others. Writing about the  
United States as a  
reincarnation of Ancient  
Rome requires a kind of  
retrospective imagination  
on top of perspective on  
the representation of  
Ancient Rome through media  
sources.  

What I wrote in "The United  
States Pt. I" is an  
incomplete analogy. This  
is what happens when  
big topics are discussed  
in the style of musings  
instead of empirical  
research.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Saturation of Higher Education 

Anyone that has kept up with the  
times in the developed world  
has probably already read and/or  
seen depictions of the office  
job as the job. Score! Right?!  
Young Miss,Mister,Mistre just  
graduated from college, and  
then they just hop right on  
out to the next stage in life,  
another rite of passage, to  
fetch that office job. And  
with all of those connections  
from college combined with  
those connections at their  
new office workplace, each  
and every one is fit to  
fulfill their duties and soar  
on to meet their potentials.  
And everyone is so happy,  
throwing parties every  
Friday to celebrate all the  
hard office work they did  
on the previous four days,  
sharing with each other  
their dreams of running for  
political office since they  
are so well-positioned to  
do just that after they  
save up enough money to  
pay off their beautiful  
houses in the suburbs by  
the prairie and direct the  
building and maintenance of  
empire. This is empire, right?  
Fair is fair.  

These depictions are a great  
disservice in many ways, but  
especially because they are  
dishonest through statistical  
rarity. The statistical chances  
that these "slow ride, smooth  
ride" life events occur make  
their mass promotion unfair, in  
one word. Changes occurring in  
both global and national  
economies continue to disappoint  
many that stayed up late to  
study for standardized tests  
and continued to persevere  
through the college path so  
that they can graduate and  
work occupations that do not  
require any of that knowledge,  
only the drive of brutality  
and the pettiness to watch  
over people's shoulders for  
any of their mistakes that  
can then be used against  
their benefit. Suppose one  
can chuckle at this prospect  
on the lack of guarantee from  
credentialism. Credentialism...  
first there is grade school,  
then undergraduate, then  
graduate, then post-graduate,  
then master of thy field of  
knowledge, one of the masters  
of the world. This reads like  
a very straight path, no doubt  
with some hardships here and  
there but at least it is  
manageable. And it is entirely  
fair to those capable, without  
question, because it is  
meritocratic. Be sure not to  
skip that class on Wednesday.  
On that day, secret knowledge  
will be distributed to the  
students, knowledge that  
determines how well they can  
do on that final exam. Failure  
of that final exam will seal  
their fate as a loser instead  
of a winner. The winner moves  
on to the next stage and might  
obtain that high-paying research  
position, perhaps move on to  
teaching others down the path  
that made them great. 

There is a limit to how many  
people the tertiary sector can  
employ. For a typical person  
with scant socio-economic  
protections in a region that  
is experiencing an economic  
downturn, forget about that  
person's talents and their  
looks and charms. They probably  
will not be in good financial  
standing by aiming for a  
tertiary sector job that  
pays above the median  
because they will miss and  
eventually fall flat on their  
face with only a coin to spare  
for a bandage on their face,  
metaphorically speaking. The  
expectations before and after  
making such a big decision such  
as attending higher education  
or relocating to another  
region for better work do  
not have to be compatible  
with each other; this is one  
of the great benefits of a  
free market, the absolving  
of feelings and responsibilities  
due to hardships or inadequancies  
that impede upon the fulfillment  
of so-declared goals. 

Higher education in economic  
downturns proves to be less  
of a financial success story  
than another rite of passage.  
The jobs are not all there for  
the biologists that are not  
medical doctors, scientists  
without doctorates, and  
engineers that did not attend  
military engineering school.  
Want to go work for a  
technology corporation? Get  
rich just like that, ehh?  
Do you see Miss Serena Chen  
that had to work and cry  
so hard to be a medical  
doctor only to be drowning  
in debt now with only old  
men lusting after her? Think  
about Billy Robinson, right?  
The star baseball player that  
celebrates his victories by  
having fantastic parties with  
all kinds of activity. He  
never went to college. And now  
he is a supervisor for a  
construction corporation that  
makes billions per year,  
billions, happily married  
and making $100K+ per year.  
How exactly do stories such  
as these promote more students  
to higher education? And what  
facts can be said about this  
great increase in students  
besides from there being more  
people informed and versed  
through instruction and  
material that was distributed  
en masse to them according  
to planned curriculums. Will  
the planned economy do any  
better?

Why people cannot have nice  
things? Must intellect that  
is underutilized in the labor  
market (not talking about  
off-time) put itself towards  
devising schemes for self-gain  
and insulting other peoples'  
intelligence? Is there no  
other noble path besides  
from running off into the  
wilderness to become a  
hermit? Is the mismatch  
between education and career  
really about the money and  
status or is it due to the  
transition bridge from education  
to career that has no guide or  
builder but the individual  
themself to decide and work  
on? Then why are there  
roadblocks? Why is there  
pestilence far away and at  
home? Can some people really  
be let go to live their own  
life?  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# To Love the Attack Surface

People are attracted to many  
things, generally speaking.  
Objects. Concepts. Attributes.  
Objects that embody certain  
concepts or carry specific  
attributes. The attacker is  
attracted to one thing in  
their prospective prey. It  
is the attack surface that  
the prospect possesses.  
Weakness is not a desired  
trait to merge with strength  
to become a different kind  
of one and whole, since it  
is obvious reasoning that  
weakness when combined with  
strength dulls the strength,  
enmeshes it into webs of  
inefficiency and nondeliberate  
mistakes. The resultant is  
something that could have  
remained great if the  
unnecessary incorporation of  
the weak was not made. But  
when the attacker does not  
care for the prospect in ways  
that negatively affect their  
independent status, then the  
attacker develops an attraction  
for the prospect that excludes  
the prospect's well-being.  
Instances of this attraction  
occurring are intriguing to  
observe, although no specific  
examples are provided in this  
writing. 

The attraction for the prospect  
is coupled with a keen  
fascination for the attack  
surface the prospect possesses.  
The attack surface embodies  
the structure of variables  
(independent,dependent, or  
codependent) termed vulnerability  
points that belong to the  
possessor, those variables'  
possible range of values, and  
reactive sets of variables that  
"complement" these vulnerability  
points. There is a kind of logic  
that goes into the design of  
the attack surface belonging to  
the prospect, and this design  
in some contexts is not so  
readily modifiable by the  
prospect but inherent. But  
generally speaking, if the  
vulnerability points of the  
surface have been accurately  
recognized by the attacker,  
then the attacker's offenses  
onto any of the points are,  
metaphorically speaking, an  
injection that could take  
many forms (concentrated,  
diluted, explosive,gradual,  
reactive, covert, etc.) with  
the aims of adversely affecting  
the formation (items, attributes,  
etc.) that the point, exploited  
through its vulnerability, is  
connected to. And this formation  
is connected in some meaningful  
way to the possessor that is  
the prospect of the attack/s.  
To have knowledge of the  
existence of a vulnerability  
point is not enough for the  
attacker in complex designs. The  
vulnerability point may be coupled  
with another vulnerability point  
by defensive and coordinated  
mechanisms. Also, the  
vulnerability of the point can  
only be accessed by passing values  
that fit the vulnerability's range  
of possible values, where "possible"  
values are allowed entry into  
the point through its  
vulnerability. But "entry" does  
not always equal to gains by  
the attacker in ways that  
enhance their probabilities  
of success against the prospect  
via the targeting of their  
attack surface. The design of  
the attack surface allows there  
to be offensive-defensive measures  
past the entry. For the injection  
by the attacker through one or  
more vulnerability points to  
be categorized a success, the  
attacker must first resort  
to a premeditation that is at  
least pseudo-precise (fuzzy)  
in determining the subset of  
possible values that would  
most adversely affect the  
prospect, and in ways that  
do not kick back at the  
attacker when the attacker  
is finitely resourced. This  
subset of possible values are  
the complements for the  
vulnerability point, and there  
is a likelihood that the  
complements are specific to  
the attacker based on their  
resources and capabilities.  

The complexity of the offensive  
and defensive mechanisms  
connected to the attack surface  
does not directly correlate to  
the difficulty of an attacker's  
success against the possessor.  
Rather, the specific complexity  
corresponds to specific complements  
(if any complement exists for the  
attacker) from the attacker  
against the prospect through  
their attack surface. For  
instance, the attacker may have  
to vary the magnitude of each  
injection, chain together many  
injections in temporal  
patterns undefensible by the  
attack surface's mechanisms,  
and modify appearances and  
executions of injections in  
ways undetectable by the  
prospect.
