*NOTE: these are musings and should not be interpreted as absolute truths*

# Goals

How can I possibly say that it is fair,  
When hard work is paid in pennies,  
And this is not a poem,  
To share with an insane Rome,  
When it lies so much as to ruin memories,  
Who cares, I dare.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Education, Career, Family, and Home Sweet Home

Why do I, at this age, not have a professional position
that pays me anything more but pennies? Let's see, there
was education via one of the U.S.A's college systems
(and at a liberal arts college no less, go me!) which took
a while for me to graduate from. And then there was the job
market and the COVID-19 pandemic, which were so full of 
SH** that I got left behind in the dust. I finally scored
a job as a technician for an electronics corporation, but
guess what... I was living in Portland, OR, (Portlandia sucks
by the way) and could not stand the environment, so leaving
back yonder "home" was what happened instead of me staying
on board as a technician.

In conclusion, that is why I feel as though I have not been
given my dues. I quite literally own so little that if I 
told someone else about my circumstances, they would laugh in
pity. I feel as though I have been done dirty, but from 
systematic mass policies (`o yah yah, nuthin personal, 
strictly business` [yeah okay...]). I hate my hometown because
it never did offer me much financial opportunities. And I also 
hate this additional fact, that if I were given my dues (although 
they would be need to be multiplied due to the loss of time), 
that I would be given additional problems as well. So much for 
the spirit of capitalism. These cons and thieves can eat SH**. 
Suck on DeezNuts!

*aside*  
Did I just use the word `hate` more than once in the last paragraph?!
Well, I guess it is official now. I really am a hater, isn't I? 
I'm not entitled, I am the title. I am...  
*end aside*

As for `home sweet home`, so much for all the love that supposedly 
happened. I'm not your one-hit wonder, and you'd best keep your
sad and pathetic FOCKING history and my personal life separate,
mmkay?! Is that cool with you, because I'm not going to keep
on playing along with the curse anymore, got that?! Understand?!
I do not need counseling. I do not need to talk about my emotions.
I do not need a woman companion in my life when there is that kind
of spirit in the air. 

Look at how tough and confident I am. Walking along in this course
of time, an equal among equals that is my neo-Roman peers. Wow, what
a powerful and magnificent neo-Roman empire that I am a citizen in.
Strutting around being the big guy without a care, because guess 
what?! You don't need to know, that's what!! Oh, and FOCK Nero. 
Everybody should hate Nero, no joke.

*aside*  
Yes, Mother! Yes, I will be home in a little bit. I know it's past  
your curfew. Please do not ground me!  
*end aside*

*aside*  
Wow, little sister Connie McLoughlin! You've grown so confident these  
past couple years. I would hate to get in your way, now that you are  
a full-grown hossie diva!  
*end aside*  

*aside*  
Wow, little brother Raymond Thompson! I see you rocking those new  
tattoos, dropping out of school, and fitting in with all those  
blue-collar guys.  
*end aside*

# Toxic Positivity 
What a good time to be alive. I can feel the aura of magnificence through
my five senses and beyond. The jolly wholly-hoppersteins alongside the
tranquility of grasshoppers eating their next meal is a great example 
of these feelings. 

*aside*  
I have deep-seated issues! I swear! Wah-wah, letting it all out by 
unknowingly ingesting truth serum first.  
*end aside*

*aside*  
FOCK.YOU.  
GO.FOCK.YOURSELF.  
FOCK.YOU.  
FOCK.YOUR.FAMILY.  
FOCK.YOUR.COVER.  
FOCK.YOUR.PRETENSE.  

YOU.ARE.THE.ONE.WITH.PROBLEMS.  
GOD.DAMN.YOU.  
*end aside*  

*aside*   
Who am I?! Ricardo Antonio Bassanio ?!  
Peter Lambucci ?! DAFOCK?!?!

# A New Wisdom

Why I no longer want to be part of the race, after discovering that  
the race is all a rat race? Is that really a question? And I do not  
care to play along with the stupid tricks of old men. Yes. Yes. Call  
me a bastard now, as if you thought more highly of me before. As for  
these "Athena" types, please for your own good, take your wars  
somewhere else. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Younglings Are Worse

Remember what I said about the stupid tricks of old men. Old men,
despite their arrogance, are actually not dumb as a demographic.
It's the younglings. I'm not your big brother. The pressure's on 
you, you little FOCK. Watcha gon do?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Messed-Up Individualism

Hey... if anybody asks, I'll tell them that I do not stick out like
a sore thumb. And then if I feel like it, I'll tell them it's because
the collective never accepted me. Problem solved.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Necessary Apology and Respect

OK. Remember what I wrote about Nero? Well, I take that back completely.
Like so so sorry. I did not know that he was thee Emperor. Gosh... where
are my manners when I let my mind move ahead of its axis? 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# So This is My True Face

All the hate that I must represent. Go on. Chime in. FOCKING phony.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# South FL

Sucks bananas. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# More Drama, Please

Have you heard of Netflix?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# They Are Too Good For You Now

What?! Who?! Have we met?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The City Must Be Great

NYC? San Francisco? Shanghai? London? The possibilities must be endless...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Listen To Me, Please

Please. I gently ask you to listen to me, during these times very much trying for everyone.
Take my hand, and I will show you the world (not, and I never went to a liberal arts college
either). I will not liberate you. I do not believe in art, only arts. And what cannot exist
in a singular form cannot possibly be true in a plural form.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Why So Aggressive?

It is part of the zeitgeist that bonds us all, for a better  
world that is the planet Earth shaped as a globe.  

Sincerely, Yours Truly. 

Thank you for letting me speak, even if I had to shout above
your shouts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The 4th Industrial Revolution

I feel like there is a lot of misunderstanding around what  
exactly is the change. But there is no fun in knowing it all.  
There is absolutely nothing much that will change, except for  
the jobs people will do. Many people must be a little scared.

I will not say another word.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Be Grateful, Be Kind 

There's a lot of FOCKED-up people around. Now I don't want to
sound like a hater, but the FOCKED-up veterans w/o jobs, the 
FOCKED-up homelessness, some of these so-called "businesses", 
and BLAH BLAH BLAH means that I am entitled to not be grateful 
or be kind. Of course, there is virtue to being grateful and 
being kind, goes the many wise sayings. But it is not up to 
any one person to be grateful or be kind. 

There is no social obligation to be grateful or be kind, to 
clarify, because rules cannot be arranged to wholly capture
what is gratefulness or what is kindness. And this truism 
might add on to the FOCKED-upness. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Philosophy is Useless

It is supposed to be. It seeks to construct the fundamentals
from the vantage point of the thinker and stops when it is 
done rationalizing the base. No one philosophizes when they 
are working.

Philosophy is a thinker's hobby and another one of politic's
many tools.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Moving to the City

Well, I'm packing my bags now. It's been nice, but there is 
a grand city waiting for my arrival (yeah FOCKING right). 

*two months later*

What a zoo... And the madhouse business is right next door.
Incredible. Unbelievable. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Thank God for Family Values

Who can actually dismiss family values as nothing, when the
economy so evidently bellied up? 

Failure of the economy --> thank God for family values.

Well, I'm broke now. Time to go back to family, and be another
leech to treat the sick and dying.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reduction to Rags

The old dirtbag can't work. Well, so be it. There's social welfare in this country  
(well, the parts of the country that don't oppose social security). 

Hey, no disrespect to the gerontocracy, but I got my own life to live. You really  
gonna try reducing me to rags? Hey... this isn't hubris. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Special Select

Blessed be those that are specially selected to fulfill their dreams before 
first having to encounter the most trivial of problems compounded into 
monstrosities. I cannot say that they live on this planet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# It is a Crisis!

It's another one of those Godzilla scenes!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Dull Patriarch

Look at the head of the household. Family values! Big man!
Don't let it get to your head now, big man!

Oh! It's head honcho! King of the hill!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Way

Your old ways do not put me to shame. What puts me to shame
is having to obey your way when there is a better way.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Leadership Issues

So there needs to be a leader or pack of leaders leading at  
the forefront. Where are they? Sipping fine wine and making  
love to each other while everyone else is to labor away?  

The old ones are becoming unfit, are they not? But some of   
the newer ones have just as many issues, probably passed  
down from the old ones.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Lost Love

What strange way to wake up in the middle of a deep sleep,  
and think long and hard on the love that could have been  
but never happened. 

And so here is another tale of lonesomeness.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# It Is Not That Great

Oh, finally ends were met and emotions were let out.  
But it is over now and to each their own must they depart.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Bargain and the Strings 

The deal has been reached. What was once nothing from the  
eyes of the value system now has worth equal to its labor  
and rarity. But what is this? There are these conditions  
attached with this influx of monies?! All these conditions?!  
And why are these conditions so open to interpretation?!  

Maybe this is a bad deal...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# After the Anger

After the anger, there is a lethargy that sets into the  
spirit. What was once the fuel that drove the motives  
behind the spirit to drive forward, uni-directionally,  
without the restraints of mental barriers that previously  
existed, is now exhausted. 

And the remaining energy? To repent, to give up, to  
conjure up more anger, or to celebrate? 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Curse

The curse requires a believer in it. Additionally,  
the curse requires repetition of the pre-requisites  
necessary for it to unfold.  Such repetition  
can occur through examples such as deliberate or    
indeliberate human behaviors and environmental  
constructs suitable for the curse to manifest  
itself. The curse demands an inevitability  
that stems from the inability or stubbornness  
to change.  

I do not wish to delve more into the matter.  
I do not practice black magic.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Misery Best Left Alone

So there is misery, and a cause for this misery.  
And after all the sad songs are sung, there is  
still that misery. The cause of the misery, the  
solution and the problem.  

If that is all to it, misery is best left alone  
lest misery is to be shared, and then the cause  
of that misery, what was deemed the solution and  
the problem, is now uncontrovertibly the problem.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Time and Place For Profanity

Profanity is a big party foul. But I did not  
attend the party.

Does this make sense? Are you OK with that?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Complex Problems

Require more than just strong men, although the odds would be better.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The New Way

Big announcement. Big marketing. The New Way! Here it comes!  

*some time later*

The new way will need a lot more time to take effect. There are  
a plethora of problems with all these dilly-dackadoos, systems,  
economics,...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Thoughts

These are your thoughts, world. Your thoughts.  
I merely took the liberty of writing them down for you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Your Admirer

Is not your friend when you two have to compete with each other.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The New Gen

*spoiler alert*  
New generation. New problems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# An Unspoken Perversion

Is always expressed in different ways by different lights.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Distant Love

Is dead when you rather talk to yourself in front of the mirror.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Correct Continuity

Is still controversial in the debate room.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Money

Is a symbol, a responsibility, an incomplete form of transfer,  
an objective, and a continuity.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Empire 

Is best learned about through the history books. 
There are only facts, beliefs, and constructs in  
this life you live.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Neighborhood Vandal

Keyed the entire left side of my vehicle, no lie.  
They say I'm a leftist. A sorry loser.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Paint Job

It's OK, I got a paint job, like that one lady   
that puts makeup on every single time before  
doing the dirty with every single person except  
you. Say whaat?! What am I talking about?!

I'm looking for an EV anyways. Nothing fancy,  
but definitely not traditional. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Not Funny

Was it supposed to be? 

*of quips and wits*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Automated Writing

Word to the wise, don't feel sorry for all of the  
writers getting laid off because of automated  
writing and speaking.  

The professional ones were always like  
"every dog has its day",  
"it's only fair"  
just a few years back. Or ...  
"it's a tragedy",  
"it's a sensation".    

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Power of Subjectivity

Do not underestimate any one person's  
need for subjectivity.  

There is a lot of business involved  
in subjectivity. And this statement  
cannot really be disputed.  

If the person is in charge, and they  
want to maintain an iron grip on every  
person below, there is absolutely the  
possibility that they will bring any  
challenge or challenger into question,  
this being the realm of subjectivity,  
if they feel as though such acts would   
enhance their social position as the  
one in charge. And this same person in  
charge will also ensure that they are  
not seen in a subjective light by those  
below them, since to be subjective  
naturally corresponds to being open to  
question.  

Subjectivity is not reserved only for  
politics. When the machinations of science,   
that is technology and logistics, fall short  
of understanding or solving the problem,  
whichever may be the goal, then subjectivity  
is called for so that different interpretations  
can be made towards different conclusions that  
hopefully (as in by some measure of chance)  
perform better.  

Subjectivity is a tool for consensus when  
it does not lean so heavily towards strong  
differences in opinions and actions. The  
common saying is "agree to disagree".  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Social Pressures

Are tools that do not work when they do  
not relate to the core, the central point  
that they push on, especially if the core  
is not bounded by all degrees.  

As to the morality of binding things, that  
is a discussion and a writing that will  
remain incomplete.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is Empire

The word "empire" carries such rich and diverse  
interpretations. You see it in the movies, the  
shows, and in the writings from both sides of  
the bridge.

The Roman Empire is an exemplar in the genre of  
"empire". 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Not About the Money

It's not entirely about anything. The mind is   
malleable and must be re-calibrated from time  
to time so that focus is maintained.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Save Your Words

Your words will fall on deaf ears,  
and your writings will be looked at  
by the illiterate.  

Your words will be drowned out by  
other words from other speakers that  
hold more favorable positions. Your  
words, if valuable, just as well be  
spoken or written by someone else  
if they were to have their way.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Virtue of Deprivation

People get specially selected by 
the powers that be to embark upon
routes of life that put them at 
odds with what routes they would 
have originally taken if they would
have had their way, without the 
external influences from both afar
and near, based on their preferences
from the beginning. Underneath, they
may actually still prefer those 
routes of original preference,
but on the outside, they are deprived
of the experiences from those routes.

The virtue of deprivation is 
essentially based on the appearances 
of what those deprived do and how 
they act, from the standpoint that 
there are flaws in each person stemming 
from what they desire and do. 

The choice of individuals to 
wholeheartedly submit to  
embarking on the routes specially
selected by the powers that be is
a topic of long and contentious
discussion.
