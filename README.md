*NOTE: these are musings and should not be interpreted as absolute truths*

# Goals

How can I possibly say that it is fair,  
When hard work is paid in pennies,  
And this is not a poem,  
To share with an insane Rome,  
When it lies so much as to ruin memories,  
Who cares, I dare.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Education, Career, Family, and Home Sweet Home

Why do I, at this age, not have a professional position
that pays me anything more but pennies? Let's see, there
was education via one of the U.S.A's college systems
(and at a liberal arts college no less, go me!) which took
a while for me to graduate from. And then there was the job
market and the COVID-19 pandemic, which were so full of 
SH** that I got left behind in the dust. I finally scored
a job as a technician for an electronics corporation, but
guess what... I was living in Portland, OR, (Portlandia sucks
by the way) and could not stand the environment, so leaving
back yonder "home" was what happened instead of me staying
on board as a technician.

In conclusion, that is why I feel as though I have not been
given my dues. I quite literally own so little that if I 
told someone else about my circumstances, they would laugh in
pity. I feel as though I have been done dirty, but from 
systematic mass policies (`o yah yah, nuthin personal, 
strictly business` [yeah okay...]). I hate my hometown because
it never did offer me much financial opportunities. And I also 
hate this additional fact, that if I were given my dues (although 
they would be need to be multiplied due to the loss of time), 
that I would be given additional problems as well. So much for 
the spirit of capitalism. These cons and thieves can eat SH**. 
Suck on DeezNuts!

*aside*  
Did I just use the word `hate` more than once in the last paragraph?!
Well, I guess it is official now. I really am a hater, isn't I? 
I'm not entitled, I am the title. I am...  
*end aside*

As for `home sweet home`, so much for all the love that supposedly 
happened. I'm not your one-hit wonder, and you'd best keep your
sad and pathetic FOCKING history and my personal life separate,
mmkay?! Is that cool with you, because I'm not going to keep
on playing along with the curse anymore, got that?! Understand?!
I do not need counseling. I do not need to talk about my emotions.
I do not need a woman companion in my life when there is that kind
of spirit in the air. 

Look at how tough and confident I am. Walking along in this course
of time, an equal among equals that is my neo-Roman peers. Wow, what
a powerful and magnificent neo-Roman empire that I am a citizen in.
Strutting around being the big guy without a care, because guess 
what?! You don't need to know, that's what!! Oh, and FOCK Nero. 
Everybody should hate Nero, no joke.

*aside*  
Yes, Mother! Yes, I will be home in a little bit. I know it's past  
your curfew. Please do not ground me!  
*end aside*

*aside*  
Wow, little sister Connie McLoughlin! You've grown so confident these  
past couple years. I would hate to get in your way, now that you are  
a full-grown hossie diva!  
*end aside*  

*aside*  
Wow, little brother Raymond Thompson! I see you rocking those new  
tattoos, dropping out of school, and fitting in with all those  
blue-collar guys.  
*end aside*

# Toxic Positivity 
What a good time to be alive. I can feel the aura of magnificence through
my five senses and beyond. The jolly wholly-hoppersteins alongside the
tranquility of grasshoppers eating their next meal is a great example 
of these feelings. 

*aside*  
I have deep-seated issues! I swear! Wah-wah, letting it all out by 
unknowingly ingesting truth serum first.  
*end aside*

*aside*  
FOCK.YOU.

# A New Wisdom

Why I no longer want to be part of the race, after discovering that  
the race is all a rat race? Is that really a question? And I do not  
care to play along with the stupid tricks of old men. Yes. Yes. Call  
me a bastard now, as if you thought more highly of me before. As for  
these "Athena" types, please for your own good, take your wars  
somewhere else. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Younglings Are Worse

Remember what I said about the stupid tricks of old men. Old men,
despite their arrogance, are actually not dumb as a demographic.
It's the younglings. I'm not your big brother. The pressure's on 
you, you little FOCK. Watcha gon do?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Messed-Up Individualism

Hey... if anybody asks, I'll tell them that I do not stick out like
a sore thumb. And then if I feel like it, I'll tell them it's because
the collective never accepted me. Problem solved.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Necessary Apology and Respect

OK. Remember what I wrote about Nero? Well, I take that back completely.
Like so so sorry. I did not know that he was thee Emperor. Gosh... where
are my manners when I let my mind move ahead of its axis? 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# So This is My True Face

All the hate that I must represent. Go on. Chime in. FOCKING phony.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# South FL

Sucks bananas. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# More Drama, Please

Have you heard of Netflix?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# They Are Too Good For You Now

What?! Who?! Have we met?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The City Must Be Great

NYC? San Francisco? Shanghai? London? The possibilities must be endless...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Listen To Me, Please

Please. I gently ask you to listen to me, during these times very much trying for everyone.
Take my hand, and I will show you the world (not, and I never went to a liberal arts college
either). I will not liberate you. I do not believe in art, only arts. And what cannot exist
in a singular form cannot possibly be true in a plural form.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Why So Aggressive?

It is part of the zeitgeist that bonds us all, for a better  
world that is the planet Earth shaped as a globe.  

Sincerely, Yours Truly. 

Thank you for letting me speak, even if I had to shout above
your shouts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The 4th Industrial Revolution

I feel like there is a lot of misunderstanding around what  
exactly is the change. But there is no fun in knowing it all.  
There is absolutely nothing much that will change, except for  
the jobs people will do. Many people must be a little scared.

I will not say another word.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Be Grateful, Be Kind 

There's a lot of FOCKED-up people around. Now I don't want to
sound like a hater, but the FOCKED-up veterans w/o jobs, the 
FOCKED-up homelessness, some of these so-called "businesses", 
and BLAH BLAH BLAH means that I am entitled to not be grateful 
or be kind. Of course, there is virtue to being grateful and 
being kind, goes the many wise sayings. But it is not up to 
any one person to be grateful or be kind. 

There is no social obligation to be grateful or be kind, to 
clarify, because rules cannot be arranged to wholly capture
what is gratefulness or what is kindness. And this truism 
might add on to the FOCKED-upness. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Philosophy is Useless

It is supposed to be. It seeks to construct the fundamentals
from the vantage point of the thinker and stops when it is 
done rationalizing the base. No one philosophizes when they 
are working.

Philosophy is a thinker's hobby and another one of politic's
many tools.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Moving to the City

Well, I'm packing my bags now. It's been nice, but there is 
a grand city waiting for my arrival (yeah FOCKING right). 

*two months later*

What a zoo... And the madhouse business is right next door.
Incredible. Unbelievable. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Thank God for Family Values

Who can actually dismiss family values as nothing, when the
economy so evidently bellied up? 

Failure of the economy --> thank God for family values.

Well, I'm broke now. Time to go back to family, and be another
leech to treat the sick and dying.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reduction to Rags

The old dirtbag can't work. Well, so be it. There's social welfare in this country  
(well, the parts of the country that don't oppose social security). 

Hey, no disrespect to the gerontocracy, but I got my own life to live. You really  
gonna try reducing me to rags? Hey... this isn't hubris. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Special Select

Blessed be those that are specially selected to fulfill their dreams before 
first having to encounter the most trivial of problems compounded into 
monstrosities. I cannot say that they live on this planet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# It is a Crisis!

It's another one of those Godzilla scenes!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Dull Patriarch

Look at the head of the household. Family values! Big man!
Don't let it get to your head now, big man!

Oh! It's head honcho! King of the hill!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Way

Your old ways do not put me to shame. What puts me to shame
is having to obey your way when there is a better way.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Leadership Issues

So there needs to be a leader or pack of leaders leading at  
the forefront. Where are they? Sipping fine wine and making  
love to each other while everyone else is to labor away?  

The old ones are becoming unfit, are they not? But some of   
the newer ones have just as many issues, probably passed  
down from the old ones.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Lost Love

What strange way to wake up in the middle of a deep sleep,  
and think long and hard on the love that could have been  
but never happened. 

And so here is another tale of lonesomeness.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# It Is Not That Great

Oh, finally ends were met and emotions were let out.  
But it is over now and to each their own must they depart.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Bargain and the Strings 

The deal has been reached. What was once nothing from the  
eyes of the value system now has worth equal to its labor  
and rarity. But what is this? There are these conditions  
attached with this influx of monies?! All these conditions?!  
And why are these conditions so open to interpretation?!  

Maybe this is a bad deal...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# After the Anger

After the anger, there is a lethargy that sets into the  
spirit. What was once the fuel that drove the motives  
behind the spirit to drive forward, uni-directionally,  
without the restraints of mental barriers that previously  
existed, is now exhausted. 

And the remaining energy? To repent, to give up, to  
conjure up more anger, or to celebrate? 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Curse

The curse requires a believer in it. Additionally,  
the curse requires repetition of the pre-requisites  
necessary for it to unfold.  Such repetition  
can occur through examples such as deliberate or    
indeliberate human behaviors and environmental  
constructs suitable for the curse to manifest  
itself. The curse demands an inevitability  
that stems from the inability or stubbornness  
to change.  

I do not wish to delve more into the matter.  
I do not practice black magic.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Misery Best Left Alone

So there is misery, and a cause for this misery.  
And after all the sad songs are sung, there is  
still that misery. The cause of the misery, the  
solution and the problem.  

If that is all to it, misery is best left alone  
lest misery is to be shared, and then the cause  
of that misery, what was deemed the solution and  
the problem, is now uncontrovertibly the problem.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Time and Place For Profanity

Profanity is a big party foul. But I did not  
attend the party.

Does this make sense? Are you OK with that?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Complex Problems

Require more than just strong men, although the odds would be better.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The New Way

Big announcement. Big marketing. The New Way! Here it comes!  

*some time later*

The new way will need a lot more time to take effect. There are  
a plethora of problems with all these dilly-dackadoos, systems,  
economics,...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Thoughts

These are your thoughts, world. Your thoughts.  
I merely took the liberty of writing them down for you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Your Admirer

Is not your friend when you two have to compete with each other.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The New Gen

*spoiler alert*  
New generation. New problems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# An Unspoken Perversion

Is always expressed in different ways by different lights.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Distant Love

Is dead when you rather talk to yourself in front of the mirror.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Correct Continuity

Is still controversial in the debate room.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Money

Is a symbol, a responsibility, an incomplete form of transfer,  
an objective, and a continuity.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Empire 

Is best learned about through the history books. 
There are only facts, beliefs, and constructs in  
this life you live.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Neighborhood Vandal

Keyed the entire left side of my vehicle, no lie.  
They say I'm a leftist. A sorry loser.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Paint Job

It's OK, I got a paint job, like that one lady   
that puts makeup on every single time before  
doing the dirty with every single person except  
you. Say whaat?! What am I talking about?!

I'm looking for an EV anyways. Nothing fancy,  
but definitely not traditional. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Not Funny

Was it supposed to be? 

*of quips and wits*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Automated Writing

Word to the wise, don't feel sorry for all of the  
writers getting laid off because of automated  
writing and speaking.  

The professional ones were always like  
"every dog has its day",  
"it's only fair"  
just a few years back. Or ...  
"it's a tragedy",  
"it's a sensation".    

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Power of Subjectivity

Do not underestimate any one person's  
need for subjectivity.  

There is a lot of business involved  
in subjectivity. And this statement  
cannot really be disputed.  

If the person is in charge, and they  
want to maintain an iron grip on every  
person below, there is absolutely the  
possibility that they will bring any  
challenge or challenger into question,  
this being the realm of subjectivity,  
if they feel as though such acts would   
enhance their social position as the  
one in charge. And this same person in  
charge will also ensure that they are  
not seen in a subjective light by those  
below them, since to be subjective  
naturally corresponds to being open to  
question.  

Subjectivity is not reserved only for  
politics. When the machinations of science,   
that is technology and logistics, fall short  
of understanding or solving the problem,  
whichever may be the goal, then subjectivity  
is called for so that different interpretations  
can be made towards different conclusions that  
hopefully (as in by some measure of chance)  
perform better.  

Subjectivity is a tool for consensus when  
it does not lean so heavily towards strong  
differences in opinions and actions. The  
common saying is "agree to disagree".  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Social Pressures

Are tools that do not work when they do  
not relate to the core, the central point  
that they push on, especially if the core  
is not bounded by all degrees.  

As to the morality of binding things, that  
is a discussion and a writing that will  
remain incomplete.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is Empire

The word "empire" carries such rich and diverse  
interpretations. You see it in the movies, the  
shows, and in the writings from both sides of  
the bridge.

The Roman Empire is an exemplar in the genre of  
"empire". 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Not About the Money

It's not entirely about anything. The mind is   
malleable and must be re-calibrated from time  
to time so that focus is maintained.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Save Your Words

Your words will fall on deaf ears,  
and your writings will be looked at  
by the illiterate.  

Your words will be drowned out by  
other words from other speakers that  
hold more favorable positions. Your  
words, if valuable, just as well be  
spoken or written by someone else  
if they were to have their way.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Virtue of Deprivation

People get specially selected by  
the powers that be to embark upon  
routes of life that put them at  
odds with what routes they would  
have originally taken if they would  
have had their way, without the  
external influences from both afar  
and near, based on their preferences  
from the beginning. Underneath, they  
may actually still prefer those  
routes of original preference,  
but on the outside, they are deprived  
of the experiences from those routes.  

The virtue of deprivation is  
essentially based on the appearances  
of what those deprived do and how  
they act, from the standpoint that  
there are flaws in each person stemming  
from what they desire and do.  

The choice of individuals to  
wholeheartedly submit to  
embarking on the routes specially  
selected by the powers that be is    
a topic of long and contentious  
discussion.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Out of Line

Give the person a place they  
feel comfortable in, on the  
condition that they must appear to  
be a nice person by saying and  
doing nice things, and you will  
not hear or see much on the surface.  

Feed people vocabulary terms that  
have contentious interpretations,  
such as capitalism and socialism,  
and take them out of their comfort  
zone. Then you will hear outcries  
against "capitalism", against  
"socialism", against all of these  
"-isms", alongside personal attacks. 

Making people see the "light"?  
That is a question. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Thievery

Thievery is an interesting topic  
for discussion. It happens in both  
capitalist and socialist systems. In  
one, there is for personal gain. In  
the other, it is for the greater good.  

Thievery comes in many forms. In some  
places, it is akin to taking candy from  
a baby. In other places, it is more  
outright conflict.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Stoop Down

Equity policy time! Every person that  
is not of royalty and does not have  
proof that they are descended from  
royalty and is not an indisputable  
conqueror needs to give up their  
ambition, at least half of their  
personal belongings, do not act so  
smart, and know their place! Or else  
they will be labelled as unequal!  

Only the greatest individuals can  
enter the contest. Only those that  
can pay can be spectators.  

This is New Rome, people! Do as the  
New Romans do, speak as a New Roman  
and be gladly accepted into a role  
that you may not like or speak freely  
and suffer the consequences. Free  
speech is not free, and freedom is  
not free!

For a better day today, tomorrow, and  
for the foreseeable future in New Rome!  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Glories of Strangers

A complete stranger and their tales of
conquest or liberation, in this new age
of correctness that is political makes 
for another internet article that is 
completely forgettable if there are 
present problems abound for the mind 
and body.

# A Hilarious County

I will tell you some reasons why my  
hometown in Charlotte County is  
hilarious. 

There are no white-collar jobs. It  
is suburbia. So if someone wants to  
move to Charlotte County to work in  
the technology industry, then they  
will be met with sore disappointment.  
I bet a lot of people have heard about  
the breathtaking developments in A.I.  
and other related industries. Charlotte  
County does not understand. There is  
only real estate and minumum wage. Get  
on board or drown is the moral here. 

It has an education system built on   
the Florida law of "no child left  
behind", so the statistics and the  
realities are out of touch. 

The rich old folks that move down  
here have it the best. This is an  
indisputable fact because the county  
did get voted as one of the U.S.A's  
best retirement communities.

There is a lot of small talk and  
gossip. There is small talk and  
gossip everywhere, but Charlotte  
County is unique because all of the  
small talk and gossip amounts to the    
same old same old suburbia. And it  
is predominantly serious talks and  
gossips too, not that BS meant to  
let people understand the follies  
of life. 

There is no social mobility in  
Charlotte County. It is like a little  
Constantinople Junior. The political  
people of Charlotte County are  
staunchly Republican, and seem to  
despise the federal government. But  
what is this? A hurricane called Ian  
came through a year and a half ago, and  
many residents still do not have relief  
so that their residences get rebuilt  
again. So Charlotte County wants to  
be practical now, and pushes for  
Steube, that's the House Representative  
for this county, to pressure the  
federal government for more aid  
(what a stooge). Oh, so now  
you are a pragmatist, Charlotte  
County. Before that, you were a  
traditional hub of hospitality with  
a keen focus on developing real estate  
and building apartment and hotel  
complexes for the tourism industry.  
Gotcha. Gotcha. Now I know where  
your heart is at, Charlotte County.  

You're whack, Charlotte County.   
Even if you're not as dysfunctional  
as the declining Portland of Oregon,  
there is something very wrong with you.  
I bet there is something very wrong with  
all regions of the world. It is just  
that I have had enough of you to grow  
as a person. You embody the seven  
deadly sins just as well as New York  
City, Portland of Oregon, London, and other  
metropolises that you so despise because  
they have democratic bases and you are  
so conservative and Republican. You  
don't see yourself. You hate social  
mobility and talent. And you represent  
an America that is bound to decline  
because you are so fixated on yourself.  
You Philistine swine. You and your idea  
of a banana republic.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The New Arrivals

The economy is hot, it's on fire! The  
jobs are definitely there, immigrant.  
If you're unskilled, go work blue-collar.  
It pays well, especially up north in the  
U.S.A. where there are unions and human  
rights, unlike the U.S. south according  
to the mainstream media. 

If you have an H-1B visa, you are so set  
for life here in the U.S.A. You are gold  
and can choose which Fortune 500 technology  
corporation to work for.  

What a great place to be, in the U.S.A!  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Little Paradises

I do not think my hometown is the worst.  
I spend a lot of my free time with my head  
lost in the written words of the internet.  
There is always talk of big changes coming  
from magnificent places, call them little  
paradises, that always sound so much better  
that what is already here. So in many ways,  
I am deceived into the realm of delusion.  

There seems to be problems everywhere, from   
a fair perspective. It is not really about  
getting ahead anymore when a person sees  
problems everywhere. Instead, the objective  
becomes to maintain the functionalities and  
enhance well-being. But some regions of the  
U.S.A. really are ahead by some metrics.  
From my perspective, those regions might   
be a little vain but at least they have  
something to show for besides from mass  
appeal, mass marketing, and self-promotion.  
In other words, some regions are more  
constructive and research-oriented. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Infeasibility of FOSS

F.O.S.S. stands for free and open source  
software. As many have come to realize,  
ever since COVID-19, the software  
industry is not very stable. The software  
industry, which relies on commercialization,  
seems to be having problems generating  
revenue, let alone profits. The industry  
is in many ways getting outsourced to  
less developed regions of the world,  
since they obviously need those digital  
products more. This trend means that many  
people in developed nations with either  
the potential or the existing capability  
to engineer good software products  
(scientific, reliable, not vaporware) are  
forced to go work in other industries  
that require virtually no knowledge  
in digital technologies. The advanced   
and overly technical nature of software  
development means that most software  
engineering is done by corporations, not  
governments.  

There has always been strong resistance  
from various organizations against  
open-source software. This resistance  
is so predictable from my perspective  
because F.O.S.S. usually provides  
equal benefits to their adopters  
at no monetary cost in comparison to  
commercial software. An equal competitor  
means less profits and less control.  
But the question of software maintenance  
and security alongside hardware necessary  
to run it is complicated, but is not  
monetarily free in general. This fact  
means that those that can acquire the  
hardware resources necessary to run  
these software products are at a great  
advantage to establishing a stronghold  
in the business of software. The  
semi-conductor industry is undergoing  
changes... As for the F.O.S.S.  
developers, if they are not sponsored  
to develop the F.O.S.S. anymore, then  
they are left to do whatever within  
their means, such as becoming bohemians  
or entrepreneurs. The business of software  
is very awkward from a materialist's  
perspective. There is no tangible object.  
Absolutely no tangible object. The  
software can only be uploaded or  
downloaded into tangible objects.  
The financial industry and its blockchain  
cryptocurrency splinters have vested  
interests in the software industry.  
On the less shadier side, there is  
the advertising industry that pays  
to put up these promotions,  
advertisements, and other forms of  
messaging using digital means. And  
last but not least, there is venture   
capitalism, which I will not discuss

# What is Decline?

The word "decline" rings a funny bell in  
my ears.   

To let new things in, unfiltered and  
unrefined, is a path towards decline.  

To remain both unyielding and barricaded  
in the face of change is another path  
towards decline.

To do virtually nothing, is decline.

# Now I See

Now, I still see nothing as expected  
by the empty promises from those more  
fortunate and miserable enough to  
cling on.

Well, I guess I know where to put  
my luck, in a black box.

# Why Vice and Inequality? 

Here is a question. Why are some  
regions of the world so much better  
than others measured in terms of  
effectiveness, productivity, and  
way of thinking? 

I do not think that religion can  
fully answer, because the seven  
deadly sins are a part of every  
region in this world. Maybe some  
regions of the world have magnitudes  
and ratios of the seven deadly sins  
that enable them to achieve more  
and keep more. Also, there is the  
matter of personal preference,  
meaning that some places would  
suit specific persons better than  
others.

# Say Nice Things Please

You are probably flabbergasted and  
disgusted by some of these things you  
read in this file. It is OK, here is  
my apology.  

I will say and write nice things.  
And then when you are no longer  
present, I will say really mean  
and nasty things about you, with  
the intent as to not upset you.  
And then those words will carry  
far, very far because you know,   
"sound travels and people talk".

Lo and below, what I have just  
described is modern day  
passive-aggressive politicking.  
I cannot imagine that this has  
changed much over the course of  
thousands of years of human  
civilization.

# Be the Solution, Not the Problem 

Fine, so maybe I wrote some harsh things  
about my hometown. Maybe I should try to  
be the solution, not the problem. Maybe I  
should try to put my talents and skills to  
good use. You know what they say, right?  
"Real talent can't be stifled."  

Ooh... I have some ideas. How about  
Charlotte County buy millions of dollars  
worth of robotics and start producing things  
by automation? How about Charlotte County  
stop with the ditch-digging and hire robots  
instead? How about Charlotte County build up  
a university that provides free college to  
enlighten every person that is interested?  
How about Charlotte County buy robots to do  
the lawn mowing (but so many small landscaping  
businesses would be out)? 

You see what I am talking about with these  
questions. It is vain. What I propose is vain  
and absolutely unnecessary because Charlotte  
County does not have the demographics for answers  
to those questions to swiftly appear. Other  
regions take priority.

See. I am a practical person. I understand that  
some things have to be lived with, and some things  
have to be sacrificed just because there is not  
enough initiative. That is why I remain perfectly  
comfortable no matter my state of mind or circle  
of friends.

# I am a Big Thinker! Me! 

You are probably already familiar with  
those characters in fiction and real life.  
They have big ideas, big plans, big  
aspirations. They work tirelessly to  
realize their vision. It is up to them to  
turn big ideas into a better world, a  
better realism.  

But somehow, it is incredibly difficult  
for them to do simple and normal things.  
That is because they always think big,  
and do big things and ignore the little  
things.  

Come on. Join the bandwagon. Think big  
things! Do big things! Change the world!  
Never mind the simple things that you have  
never bothered to try to do, or the many  
flaws you must have from doing big things  
all the time!

# Social Contact

Science is incomplete for the human  
experience. And that is because a lot of  
the work does not require social contact  
that is more than research collaboration.  

Social contact is vital. So vital. Without  
social contact, there is a lack of social  
contact. 

Social contact allows the human experience  
to transmit to other human experiences  
through the projection of identities,  
super-identities, egos, and super-egos. 

And don't forget, social contact is one of  
the best ways to express love. "Love is the  
answer to everything" is what many say.

# What Do People Really Do?

Serious question. Sometimes, I really do  
wonder what some people, or should I  
say, peoples (plural, denotes multiple  
persons planning or conducting  
activities with each other) do.

And then I remind myself of the four  
necessities of life, that is food, water,  
air, and shelter.

I also remind myself of basic  
psycho-analytic concepts, especially  
identity and ego, that transpose  
themselves into societal structure,  
which then reflects back into the  
perspectives of individuals' identities  
and egos, fueling their emotive states  
and ultimate wills.  

I could go on to more detailed  
explanation, but I will not. I will  
say that today's post-modernist dynamic  
has led to a lot of routes that would  
have never existed if it were not for  
the combination of wretched and  
wonderful chains of events in the past.  
Even with some of these improvements,  
I have still personally concluded  
that social arrangements such as  
tribalism still play a role in the  
hearts and minds of many, leaving the  
question of choice on the table not as  
part of an open discussion but for  
private deals.

# A Recipe with Jealousy

Jealousy operates by underhanded  
methodologies. Even the jealous know  
that jealousy is a prime factor for  
irrationalism that can just as easily  
bury them as grant them cheap victories,  
so their way about victory heavily  
emphasizes the concealment of said  
prime factor. But it is not always  
an orderly world for what exactly is  
order, goes their justification. 

Jealousy is cryptographic. It is one  
of the great drivers for deception.  
It is fair to say there are as many  
methodologies devised to detect friend,  
foe, or stranger as to conceal  
allegiance due to jealous inclinations.

A cunning jealousy exacerbates present  
problems, morphing those problems into  
greater problems through systematic  
destabilization. To clarify, pride  
can also do these things, but jealousy  
goes about it in a more underhanded  
way, because jealousy is not pride.  
Pride is the incumbent, the  
established, the powerful through  
merit of both mind and body. Jealousy  
lags behind. There are many losers,  
but jealousy does not accept its  
position until its death. When pride  
continues waving its superior stance  
to jealousy, jealousy becomes even  
more jealous. A jealousy that  
thrives is a jealousy that will  
continue its campaign, first to  
dethrone and then to be the new  
pride. And then it is no longer  
jealousy but pride, at least for  
some time. 

Much can be said and believed about  
those that embrace jealousy into their  
hearts or befriend the jealous. But  
one thing is for certain, jealousy  
is one of the seven deadly sins.

# There is No Need for Education 

When education is a system, and  
the person does not feel they would  
benefit by passing through that  
system as an input variable. The  
passing of the input variable into  
an education system induces changes  
into the input variable. What is  
interesting is that those changes  
and the initial state of the input  
variable are then reflected back  
onto the education system, causing  
the education system to be somewhat  
different than what it was originally,  
before the person passed through  
that education system. 

When education is a system, however,  
and the person chooses not to enter  
that system, then they must obviously  
take other routes and bear different  
costs and effects.

# Monotony Through Themes  

One of the great uses of expression  
is apparently to relate one thing  
as another from one to another.  
There are parallels between two  
very apparently different nouns  
or experiences, and these parallels  
are forged through the craft of  
monotonization. Some processes  
that manifest themselves differently  
but rest on the same sources  
can also be greatly and positively  
related to one another through  
explicit emphasis of the equality  
between the sources. 

One shortcoming of natural language  
is that it cannot be so readily  
interpreted past a certain point.  
It is not that the possibility for   
immediate and deep interpretation  
is not there, but natural language  
is usually used in conjunction with  
other contextual signalling. The  
permutative reaction from this  
conjunction has a high probability  
of resulting in mixed and vast  
interpretations. To demonstrate  
the true nature of some of these  
interpretations requires a  
feedback loop from the interpreter  
with themself, others, or a  
mixture of both. From the  
perspective of the central mean  
theorem, the feedback loop  
starting from the interpreter  
and ending with both themself  
and others would provide the most  
reasonable answer, given the condition  
that all of the ends of the feedback  
loop (the interpreter themself  
and others) are reliable and  
accurate judges of equal caliber.  
If the interpreter is left to their  
own devices so that only they themself  
comprise the total number of agents  
involved in the feedback loop, then  
there is a high risk of error for  
interpreters untrained overall and a  
higher risk of error for those  
inexperienced in the specific  
circumstances surrounding the  
communication.

Each feedback loop is part of a  
long chain used to maintain a  
constant bridge of accurate  
interpretation between the interpreter  
and the subject of interpretation,  
that is expressed through natural  
language. The interpreter would  
then have to constantly corroborate  
the communication of the present  
with the past to recalibrate  
interpretation towards the objective  
of a best range of answers for  
the foreseeable future where the  
subject of interpretation is to  
remain the subject for interpretation.  
And this range of answers is usually  
kept narrow for faster computation.  
By this construct, deep interpretation  
can only take place through the trials  
and errors that have taken place through  
predominantly deliberate efforts, since  
the magnitude of intention corresponds  
to a higher priority for retention of  
the specific memory for particular  
trials and errors. 

The long chain, comprised of feedback  
loops, falls under monotony through  
themes. Through the consistency that  
emerges from refinement for improved  
interpretation by the interpreter,  
events or concepts expressed through  
natural language that may not have  
originally carried any semblance to  
one another are then attached to each  
other through the forging of  
parallelism. The discovery and  
maintenance of focus on the points  
of origination, which may change in  
qualities or quantities over time,  
that which allow for relatability of  
different communication through  
natural language is a task that the  
long chain of feedback loops dedicates  
itself to. So the activities revolving  
around the points of origination also  
fall under the umbrella of monotony  
through themes.

The phrase "natural language" usually  
refers to languages with wide adopters  
spoken between human beings, but the  
definition of "natural" is puzzling (to  
say the least) because the term relies on  
the existence of a state that is, by  
default. And said state may not actually  
exist across the different regions and  
contexts of all possible interpreters.  
And the definition of "natural" is  
probably better measured in terms of  
the mutations that have occurred rather  
than the similarities that exist then  
and now. The reasoning is that the  
concept of monotony through themes  
implemented by the long chain of  
feedback loops would convolute and  
distort the past and present "natural",  
leading to errors such as delusion of  
similarity and false or overabundant  
parallelism.

# Lost For Words

If you are in this state and it is  
crucial for you to decide and act,  
and one of the elements most  
necessary for enabling this decision  
are words, then will words really  
set things straight? 

A problem in the triangle of  
initiative, mind-to-body translation,  
and fulfillment.

# Not a Promotion, Not a Flex

You think it is a promotion borne   
from selfishness, or a flex to  
exhibit strength. 

It may be from your eyes. From  
your eyes, a challenge, this  
promotion or flex, for it makes  
no difference to you, that ignites  
a flame inside you not to buy  
into the message, but to dish out  
your own flame. 

Herein lies the generalization of  
the struggles for influence or  
expression or satisfaction. The  
explanations and examples, amiss,    
for there are too many and  
exponentially many more views.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Condensation, Clarity, and Others

When vast texts can be condensed,  
for the purpose of more immediate  
clarity, then there will be others.  
To clarify, there will be other  
knowledges and other perspectives  
from different minds. What exactly  
makes differences when condensation  
can grant clarity for the confidence  
to move as one?

# The Secret To Winning

Get a lot of backing from other human  
beings. Acquire resources to make up  
for whatever physical deficits or  
inadequacies (if you are already so  
strong). Send powerful messages. Use  
a playbook written by the most  
experienced and wisest playwrights.  

Cut off the anchors and dump excess  
weight. It is time to sail (if the goal  
is to sail). 

Believe every word of this. Put all  
your hopes and dreams into these words,  
and see yourself as the reigning champion  
of them all, a true hero to the people.

# There Are No Individuals, Only Individualists

Individualism is one of the many  
ideals that human beings have come  
up with. And this particular idea is  
very appealing in theory, especially  
for those that place low emphasis on  
the permanence of social bonds and  
other forms of association such as  
financial independence that interfere  
with their way of life and expression.  
But a fellow human being has a degree  
of influence proportional to their  
actions, social connectivity, and  
physical distance concerning an  
individual, in turn enabling doubts  
to be cast on what exactly sets a  
person apart from others as an  
individual.

Individuals are ultimately human and  
fall prey to humanistic aspects such  
as identity, ego, social arrangements,  
social trends, and order. Each of these  
aspects carry with them equations in  
the form of certainties or likelihoods  
(if there is a lack of certainty) that  
result in not so much the removal of  
free will from individuals in what they  
desire to do, or what they want to  
represent, or what they think, but in  
the diminishing of choices that are  
feasible to accomplish without  
necessary external influence, that  
which is usually formulated in  
structures  of other persons' inputs.  
The phrase "to fall prey to" does  
not necessarily refer to arbitrary  
and inevitable losses or deprivations  
that an individual must experience.  
Instead, the phrase in this context  
refers primarily to the loss of  
individualism by the individual in  
such a manner that to call the person  
an individual would result in  
fallacies of their conception at least  
equal to the misconception that they  
are indeed an individual.  

One metric for gauging the  
individuality of a person is the  
strength of arguments against the  
aims of their volition. A person may  
in fact be dismissed as an individual  
due to the strength of arguments  
against their volition, when the  
person if considered in a context  
devoid of other nouns (such as other  
persons) can in fact be deemed an  
individual. And these arguments may  
rest on identity, ego, social  
arrangements, order, amongst others.  
To gauge the strength of arguments  
against a person's individuality  
requires an astute assessment of  
their repressive and suppressive  
effects on the person's expression  
and existence amongst others. And  
such repressive and suppressive  
effects must be observed through the  
lens of scenario modelling, divergent   
behavior, and the strength and nature  
of relations between the person and  
other persons.

Another metric is one that rests on  
comparative analysis, but this metric     
is related to the last concept  
regarding the observation of  
repressive and suppressive effects  
of arguments against a person's  
individuality. However, comparative  
analysis in this form does not  
necessarily take arguments against  
a person's individuality into account.  
It strives to use relevant information  
in the form of measures deemed  
"socially objective", agreed upon by  
a consensus of those both informed  
and representatively credible. Measures  
of a person's appearances, genealogy,  
and practices have stronger likelihoods  
of being recognized as socially  
objective than values placed on their  
psyche and capabilities. Comparative  
analysis takes measures such as  
these into account and attempts to  
draw "distinguishing lines of  
recognition" between a person and others.  
The objectivity wanted through  
comparative analysis places limits on  
the metric itself since the conducting  
of studies cannot go in-depth past a  
point into a person without mentioning   
the nature of arguments against the  
person's individuality that is already  
discussed in the previous paragraph  
concerning a different metric.  

To call any arbitrary person an  
individual would have a strong likelihood  
of dispute given the previous two metrics  
mentioned. The person may not, based on  
things such as their personal values and  
behavior and relations, be an individual.  
But the person can still be an  
individualist, a believer in the ideal  
of individualism. The threshold for a  
person to be an individualist is, in  
many ways, lower than that to be an  
individual. A person would simply have  
to carry with them a strong belief in  
individualism. And as for the question  
of their ability and actualization in  
upholding their personal belief in  
individualism, it would have to be  
determined under metrics such as those  
two previously mentioned. A person  
may score low in some metrics of  
individualism but still exhibit other  
appearances, behavior, and actions  
that are individualistic.
