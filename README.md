# Goals

How can I possibly say that it is fair,  
When hard work is paid in pennies,  
And this is not a poem,  
To share with an insane Rome,  
When it lies so much as to ruin memories,  
Who cares, I dare.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do I, at this age, not have a professional position
that pays me anything more but pennies. Let's see, there
was education via one of the U.S.A's college systems
(and at a liberal arts college no less, go me!) which took
a while for me to graduate from. And then there was the job
market and the COVID-19 pandemic, which were so full of 
SH** that I got left behind in the dust. I finally scored
a job as a technician for an electronics corporation, but
guess what... I was living in Portland, OR, (Portlandia sucks
by the way) and could not stand the environment, so leaving
back yonder "home" was what happened instead of me staying
on board as a technician.

In conclusion, that is why I feel as though I have not been
given my dues. I quite literally own so little that if I 
told someone else about my circumstances, they would laugh in
pity. I feel as though I have been done dirty, but from 
systematic mass policies (`o yah yah, nuthin personal, 
strictly business` [yeah okay...]). I hate my hometown because
it never did offer me much financial opportunities. And I also 
hate this additional fact, that if I were given my dues (although 
they would be need to be multiplied due to the loss of time), 
that I would be given additional problems as well. So much for 
the spirit of capitalism. These cons and thieves can eat SH**. 
Suck on DeezNuts! 

As for `home sweet home`, so much for all the love that supposedly 
happened. I'm not your one-hit wonder, and you'd best keep your
sad and pathetic FOCKING history and my personal life separate.
